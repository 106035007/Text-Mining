"We treat the parameter estimation problem for mean<U+2010>field models of large interacting financial systems such as the banking system and a pool of assets held by an institution or backing a security. We develop an asymptotic inference approach that addresses the scale and complexity of such systems. Harnessing the weak convergence results developed for mean<U+2010>field financial systems in the literature, we construct an approximate likelihood for large systems. The approximate likelihood has a conditionally Gaussian structure, enabling us to design an efficient numerical method for its evaluation. We provide a representation of the corresponding approximate estimator in terms of a weighted least<U+2010>squares estimator, and use it to analyze the large<U+2010>system and large<U+2010>sample behavior of the estimator. Numerical results for a mean<U+2010>field model of systemic financial risk highlight the efficiency and accuracy of our estimator."
"We derive analytic series representations for European option prices in polynomial stochastic volatility models. This includes the Jacobi, Heston, Stein¡VStein, and Hull¡VWhite models, for which we provide numerical case studies. We find that our polynomial option price series expansion performs as efficiently and accurately as the Fourier<U+2010>transform<U+2010>based method in the nested affine cases. We also derive and numerically validate series representations for option Greeks. We depict an extension of our approach to exotic options whose payoffs depend on a finite number of prices."
"In this paper, we report further progress toward a complete theory of state<U+2010>independent expected utility maximization with semimartingale price processes for arbitrary utility function. Without any technical assumptions, we establish a surprising Fenchel duality result on conjugate Orlicz spaces, offering a new economic insight into the nature of primal optima and providing a fresh perspective on the classical papers of Kramkov and Schachermayer. The analysis points to an intriguing interplay between no<U+2010>arbitrage conditions and standard convex optimization and motivates the study of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing for Orlicz tame strategies."
"In a capital adequacy framework, risk measures are used to determine the minimal amount of capital that a financial institution has to raise and invest in a portfolio of prespecified eligible assets in order to pass a given capital adequacy test. From a capital efficiency perspective, it is important to be able to do so at the lowest possible cost and to identify the corresponding portfolios, or, equivalently, their payoffs. We study the existence and uniqueness of such optimal payoffs as well as their behavior under a perturbation or an approximation of the underlying capital position. This behavior is naturally linked to the continuity properties of the set<U+2010>valued map that associates to each capital position the corresponding set of optimal eligible payoffs. Upper continuity can be ensured under fairly natural assumptions. Lower continuity is typically less easy to establish. While it is always satisfied in a polyhedral setting, it generally fails otherwise, even when the reference risk measure is convex. However, lower continuity can often be established for eligible payoffs that are close to being optimal. Besides capital adequacy, our results have a variety of natural applications to pricing, hedging, and capital allocation problems."
"In this paper, we develop a framework for discretely compounding interest rates that is based on the forward price process approach. This approach has a number of advantages, in particular in the current market environment. Compared to the classical as well as the Levy Libor market model, it allows in a natural way for negative interest rates and has superb calibration properties even in the presence of extremely low rates. Moreover, the measure changes along the tenor structure are significantly simplified. These properties make it an excellent base for a postcrisis multiple curve setup. Two variants for multiple curve constructions based on the multiplicative spreads are discussed. Time<U+2010>inhomogeneous Levy processes are used as driving processes. An explicit formula for the valuation of caps is derived using Fourier transform techniques. Relying on the valuation formula, we calibrate the two model variants to market data."
"In this paper, we study perpetual American call and put options in an exponential Levy model. We consider a negative effective discount rate that arises in a number of financial applications including stock loans and real options, where the strike price can potentially grow at a higher rate than the original discount factor. We show that in this case a double continuation region arises and we identify the two critical prices. We also generalize this result to multiple stopping problems of Swing type, that is, when successive exercise opportunities are separated by i.i.d. random refraction times. We conduct an extensive numerical analysis for the Black¡VScholes model and the jump<U+2010>diffusion model with exponentially distributed jumps."
"We study an optimal dividend problem under a bankruptcy constraint. Firms face a trade<U+2010>off between potential bankruptcy and extraction of profits. In contrast to previous works, general cash flow drifts, including Ornstein¡VUhlenbeck and CIR processes, are considered. We provide rigorous proofs of continuity of the value function, whence dynamic programming, as well as comparison between discontinuous sub<U+2010> and supersolutions of the Hamilton¡VJacobi¡VBellman equation, and we provide an efficient and convergent numerical scheme for finding the solution. The value function is given by a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with a gradient constraint from below in one direction. We find that the optimal strategy is both a barrier and a band strategy and that it includes voluntary liquidation in parts of the state space. Finally, we present and numerically study extensions of the model, including equity issuance and gambling for resurrection."
"We analyze the martingale selection problem of Rokhlin in a pointwise (robust) setting. We derive conditions for solvability of this problem and show how it is related to the classical no<U+2010>arbitrage deliberations. We obtain versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing in models spanning frictionless markets, models with proportional transaction costs, and models for illiquid markets. In all these models, we also incorporate trading constraints."
"Accounting for model uncertainty in risk management and option pricing leads to infinite<U+2010>dimensional optimization problems that are both analytically and numerically intractable. In this article, we study when this hurdle can be overcome for the so<U+2010>called optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measure¡Xincluding the average value<U+2010>at<U+2010>risk as a special case. First, we focus on the case where the uncertainty is modeled by a nonlinear expectation that penalizes distributions that are ¡§far¡¨ in terms of optimal<U+2010>transport distance (e.g. Wasserstein distance) from a given baseline distribution. It turns out that the computation of the robust OCE reduces to a finite<U+2010>dimensional problem, which in some cases can even be solved explicitly. This principle also applies to the shortfall risk measure as well as for the pricing of European options. Further, we derive convex dual representations of the robust OCE for measurable claims without any assumptions on the set of distributions. Finally, we give conditions on the latter set under which the robust average value<U+2010>at<U+2010>risk is a tail risk measure."
"We consider the problem of stopping a diffusion process with a payoff functional that renders the problem time<U+2010>inconsistent. We study stopping decisions of naive agents who reoptimize continuously in time, as well as equilibrium strategies of sophisticated agents who anticipate but lack control over their future selves' behaviors. When the state process is one dimensional and the payoff functional satisfies some regularity conditions, we prove that any equilibrium can be obtained as a fixed point of an operator. This operator represents strategic reasoning that takes the future selves' behaviors into account. We then apply the general results to the case when the agents distort probability and the diffusion process is a geometric Brownian motion. The problem is inherently time<U+2010>inconsistent as the level of distortion of a same event changes over time. We show how the strategic reasoning may turn a naive agent into a sophisticated one. Moreover, we derive stopping strategies of the two types of agent for various parameter specifications of the problem, illustrating rich behaviors beyond the extreme ones such as ¡§never<U+2010>stopping¡¨ or ¡§never<U+2010>starting.¡¨"
"We analyze a family of portfolio management problems under relative performance criteria, for fund managers having CARA or CRRA utilities and trading in a common investment horizon in log<U+2010>normal markets. We construct explicit constant equilibrium strategies for both the finite population games and the corresponding mean field games, which we show are unique in the class of constant equilibria. In the CARA case, competition drives agents to invest more in the risky asset than they would otherwise, while in the CRRA case competitive agents may over<U+2010> or underinvest, depending on their levels of risk tolerance."
"We study the optimal execution problem with multiplicative price impact in algorithmic trading, when an agent holds an initial position of shares of a financial asset. The interselling decision times are modeled by the arrival times of a Poisson process. The criterion to be optimized consists in maximizing the expected net present value of the gains of the agent, and it is proved that an optimal strategy has a barrier form, depending only on the number of shares left and the level of the asset price."
"We study portfolio selection in a model with both temporary and transient price impact introduced by Garleanu and Pedersen. In the large<U+2010>liquidity limit where both frictions are small, we derive explicit formulas for the asymptotically optimal trading rate and the corresponding minimal leading<U+2010>order performance loss. We find that the losses are governed by the volatility of the frictionless target strategy, like in models with only temporary price impact. In contrast, the corresponding optimal portfolio not only tracks the frictionless optimizer, but also exploits the displacement of the market price from its unaffected level."
"In this paper, we derive a variation of the Azema martingale using two approaches¡Xa direct probabilistic method and another by projecting the Kennedy martingale onto the filtration generated by the drawdown duration. This martingale links the time elapsed since the last maximum of the Brownian motion with the maximum process itself. We derive explicit formulas for the joint densities of (£n,W£n,M£n), which are the first time the drawdown period hits a prespecified duration, the value of the Brownian motion, and the maximum up to this time. We use the results to price a new type of drawdown option, which takes into account both dimensions of drawdown risk¡Xthe magnitude and the duration."
"In various fields of applications such as capital allocation, sensitivity analysis, and systemic risk evaluation, one often needs to compute or estimate the expectation of a random variable, given that another random variable is equal to its quantile at some prespecified probability level. A primary example of such an application is the Euler capital allocation formula for the quantile (often called the value<U+2010>at<U+2010>risk), which is of crucial importance in financial risk management. It is well known that classic nonparametric estimation for the above quantile allocation problem has a slower rate of convergence than the standard rate. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to the quantile allocation problem via adjusting the probability level in connection with an expected shortfall. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed nonparametric estimator of the new capital allocation is derived for dependent data under the setup of a mixing sequence. In order to assess the performance of the proposed nonparametric estimator, AR<U+2010>GARCH models are proposed to fit each risk variable, and further, a bootstrap method based on residuals is employed to quantify the estimation uncertainty. A simulation study is conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed inference. Finally, the proposed methodology of quantile capital allocation is illustrated for a financial data set."
"This paper provides a new explanation for closed<U+2010>end fund (CEF) discounts and premiums using the local martingale theory of asset price bubbles. This is a rational asset pricing model that is shown to be consistent with the existing empirical evidence on CEF discounts/premiums. Additional testable implications of the model are derived, which await subsequent research for their resolution. This bubble theory also applies equally well to understanding discounts and premiums on exchange traded funds."
"Rough stochastic volatility models have attracted a lot of attention recently, in particular for the linear option pricing problem. In this paper, starting with power utilities, we propose to use a martingale distortion representation of the optimal value function for the nonlinear asset allocation problem in a (non<U+2010>Markovian) fractional stochastic environment (for all values of the Hurst index H<U+2208>(0,1)). We rigorously establish a first<U+2010>order approximation of the optimal value, when the return and volatility of the underlying asset are functions of a stationary slowly varying fractional Ornstein¡VUhlenbeck process. We prove that this approximation can be also generated by a fixed zeroth<U+2010> order trading strategy providing an explicit strategy which is asymptotically optimal in all admissible controls. Furthermore, we extend the discussion to general utility functions, and obtain the asymptotic optimality of this fixed strategy in a specific family of admissible strategies."
"Alpha signals for statistical arbitrage strategies are often driven by latent factors. This paper analyzes how to optimally trade with latent factors that cause prices to jump and diffuse. Moreover, we account for the effect of the trader's actions on quoted prices and the prices they receive from trading. Under fairly general assumptions, we demonstrate how the trader can learn the posterior distribution over the latent states, and explicitly solve the latent optimal trading problem. We provide a verification theorem, and a methodology for calibrating the model by deriving a variation of the expectation¡Vmaximization algorithm. To illustrate the efficacy of the optimal strategy, we demonstrate its performance through simulations and compare it to strategies that ignore learning in the latent factors. We also provide calibration results for a particular model using Intel Corporation stock as an example."
"Cover's celebrated theorem states that the long<U+2010>run yield of a properly chosen ¡§universal¡¨ portfolio is almost as good as that of the best retrospectively chosen constant rebalanced portfolio. The ¡§universality¡¨ refers to the fact that this result is model<U+2010>free, that is, not dependent on an underlying stochastic process. We extend Cover's theorem to the setting of stochastic portfolio theory: the market portfolio is taken as the numeraire, and the rebalancing rule need not be constant anymore but may depend on the current state of the stock market. By fixing a stochastic model of the stock market this model<U+2010>free result is complemented by a comparison with the numeraire portfolio. Roughly speaking, under appropriate assumptions the asymptotic growth rate coincides for the three approaches mentioned in the title of this paper. We present results in both discrete and continuous time."
"We review the notion of a linearity<U+2010>generating (LG) process introduced by Gabaix and relate LG processes to linear<U+2010>rational (LR) models studied by Filipovi<U+0107> et al. We show that every LR model can be represented as an LG process and vice versa. We find that LR models have two basic properties that make them an important representation of LG processes. First, LR models can be easily specified and made consistent with nonnegative interest rates. Second, LR models go naturally with the long<U+2010>term risk factorization due to Alvarez and Jermann, Hansen and Scheinkman, and Qin and Linetsky. Every LG process under the long forward measure can be represented as a lower dimensional LR model."
"Empirical evidence suggests that fixed<U+2010>income markets exhibit unspanned stochastic volatility (USV), that is, that one cannot fully hedge volatility risk solely using a portfolio of bonds. While Collin<U+2010>Dufresne and Goldstein (2002, Journal of Finance, 57, 1685¡V1730) showed that no two<U+2010>factor Cox¡VIngersoll¡VRoss (CIR) model can exhibit USV, it has been unknown to date whether CIR models with more than two factors can exhibit USV or not. We formally review USV and relate it to bond market incompleteness. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a multifactor CIR model to exhibit USV. We then construct a class of three<U+2010>factor CIR models that exhibit USV. This answers in the affirmative the above previously open question. We also show that multifactor CIR models with diagonal drift matrix cannot exhibit USV."
"We consider a discrete<U+2010>time financial market with proportional transaction cost under model uncertainty, and study a superreplication problem. We recover the duality results that are well known in the classical dominated context. Our key argument consists in using a randomization technique together with the minimax theorem to convert the initial problem to a frictionless problem on an enlarged space. This allows us to appeal to the techniques and results of Bouchard and Nutz to obtain the duality result."
"We investigate the pricing¡Vhedging duality for American options in discrete time financial models where some assets are traded dynamically and others, for example, a family of European options, only statically. In the first part of the paper, we consider an abstract setting, which includes the classical case with a fixed reference probability measure as well as the robust framework with a nondominated family of probability measures. Our first insight is that, by considering an enlargement of the space, we can see American options as European options and recover the pricing¡Vhedging duality, which may fail in the original formulation. This can be seen as a weak formulation of the original problem. Our second insight is that a duality gap arises from the lack of dynamic consistency, and hence that a different enlargement, which reintroduces dynamic consistency is sufficient to recover the pricing¡Vhedging duality: It is enough to consider fictitious extensions of the market in which all the assets are traded dynamically. In the second part of the paper, we study two important examples of the robust framework: the setup of Bouchard and Nutz and the martingale optimal transport setup of Beiglbock, Henry<U+2010>Labordere, and Penkner, and show that our general results apply in both cases and enable us to obtain the pricing¡Vhedging duality for American options."
"We study Arrow¡VDebreu equilibria for a one<U+2010>period<U+2010>two<U+2010>date pure exchange economy with rank<U+2010>dependent utility agents having heterogeneous probability weighting and outcome utility functions. In particular, we allow the economy to have a mix of expected utility agents and rank<U+2010>dependent utility ones, with nonconvex probability weighting functions. The standard approach for convex economy equilibria fails due to the incompatibility with second<U+2010>order stochastic dominance. The representative agent approach devised in Xia and Zhou (2016) does not work either due to the heterogeneity of the weighting functions. We overcome these difficulties by considering the comonotone allocations, on which the rank<U+2010>dependent utilities become concave. Accordingly, we introduce the notion of comonotone Pareto optima, and derive their characterizing conditions. With the aid of the auxiliary problem of price equilibria with transfers, we provide a sufficient condition in terms of the model primitives under which an Arrow¡VDebreu equilibrium exists, along with the explicit expression of the state<U+2010>price density in equilibrium. This new, general sufficient condition distinguishes the paper from previous related studies with homogeneous and/or convex probability weightings."
"We consider a modeling setup where the volatility index (VIX) dynamics are explicitly computable as a smooth transformation of a purely diffusive, multidimensional Markov process. The framework is general enough to embed many popular stochastic volatility models. We develop closed<U+2010>form expansions and sharp error bounds for VIX futures, options, and implied volatilities. In particular, we derive exact asymptotic results for VIX<U+2010>implied volatilities, and their sensitivities, in the joint limit of short time<U+2010>to<U+2010>maturity and small log<U+2010>moneyness. The expansions obtained are explicit based on elementary functions and they neatly uncover how the VIX skew depends on the specific choice of the volatility and the vol<U+2010>of<U+2010>vol processes. Our results are based on perturbation techniques applied to the infinitesimal generator of the underlying process. This methodology has previously been adopted to derive approximations of equity (SPX) options. However, the generalizations needed to cover the case of VIX options are by no means straightforward as the dynamics of the underlying VIX futures are not explicitly known. To illustrate the accuracy of our technique, we provide numerical implementations for a selection of model specifications."
"Value<U+2010>at<U+2010>Risk (VaR) bounds for aggregated risks have been derived in the literature in settings where, besides the marginal distributions of the individual risk factors, one<U+2010>sided bounds for the joint distribution or the copula of the risks are available. In applications, it turns out that these improved standard bounds on VaR tend to be too wide to be relevant for practical applications, especially when the number of risk factors is large or when the dependence restriction is not strong enough. In this paper, we develop a method to compute VaR bounds when besides the marginal distributions of the risk factors, two<U+2010>sided dependence information in form of an upper and a lower bound on the copula of the risk factors is available. The method is based on a relaxation of the exact dual bounds that we derive by means of the Monge¡VKantorovich transportation duality. In several applications, we illustrate that two<U+2010>sided dependence information typically leads to strongly improved bounds on the VaR of aggregations."
"Experimental studies have demonstrated that a typical investor derives utility of the gain and loss, relative to certain reference point, realized at each sale of a stock, and that the reference point adapts asymmetrically to the stock's prior gains and losses in that the adaptation to a gain is more substantial than to a comparable loss. This empirical finding motivates us to consider a dynamic trading problem in which an agent decides when to sequentially sell and buy a stock in order to maximize her utility of terminal wealth and realized gains and losses based on a reference point that adapts asymmetrically to the stock's prior gains and losses. We show that this agent is more reluctant to sell the stock at a loss than another agent whose reference point does not adapt to the stock gain or loss at all, leading to a higher percentage of gains realized (PGR) and a lower percentage of losses realized (PLR). We also show that when the agent weighs the utility of realized gains and losses more heavily in her investment criteria, she trades the stock more frequently, the PGR becomes lower, and the PLR becomes higher."
"Never selling stocks is optimal for investors with a long horizon and a realistic range of preference and market parameters, if relative risk aversion, investment opportunities, proportional transaction costs, and dividend yields are constant. Such investors should buy stocks when their portfolio weight is too low and otherwise hold them, letting dividends rebalance to cash over time rather than selling. With capital gains taxes, this policy outperforms both static buy<U+2010>and<U+2010>hold and dynamic rebalancing strategies that account for transaction costs. Selling stocks becomes optimal if either their target weight is low or intermediate consumption is substantial."
"In this paper, we consider the Merton problem in a market with a single risky asset and proportional transaction costs. We give a complete solution of the problem up to the solution of a first<U+2010>crossing problem for a first<U+2010>order differential equation. We find that the characteristics of the solution (e.g., well<U+2010>posedness) can be related to some simple properties of a univariate quadratic whose coefficients are functions of the parameters of the problem. Our solution to the problem via the value function includes expressions for the boundaries of the no<U+2010>transaction wedge. Using these expressions, we prove a precise condition for when leverage occurs. One new and unexpected result is that when the solution to the Merton problem (without transaction costs) involves a leveraged position, and when transaction costs are large, the location of the boundary at which sales of the risky asset occur is independent of the transaction cost on purchases."
"In financial markets, liquidity changes randomly over time. We consider such random variations of the depth of the order book and evaluate their influence on optimal trade execution strategies. If the stochastic structure of liquidity changes satisfies certain conditions, then the unique optimal trading strategy exhibits a conventional structure with a single wait region and a single buy region, and profitable round<U+2010>trip strategies do not exist. In other cases, optimal strategies can feature multiple wait regions and optimal trade sizes that can be decreasing in the size of the position to be liquidated. Furthermore, round<U+2010>trip strategies can be profitable depending on bid¡Vask spread assumptions. We illustrate our findings with several examples including the Cox¡VIngersoll¡VRoss model for the evolution of liquidity."
"Executing a basket of co<U+2010>integrated assets is an important task facing investors. Here, we show how to do this accounting for the informational advantage gained from assets within and outside the basket, as well as for the permanent price impact of market orders (MOs) from all market participants, and the temporary impact that the agent's MOs have on prices. The execution problem is posed as an optimal stochastic control problem and we demonstrate that, under some mild conditions, the value function admits a closed<U+2010>form solution, and prove a verification theorem. Furthermore, we use data of five stocks traded in the Nasdaq exchange to estimate the model parameters and use simulations to illustrate the performance of the strategy. As an example, the agent liquidates a portfolio consisting of shares in Intel Corporation and Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF. We show that including the information provided by three additional assets (FARO Technologies, NetApp, Oracle Corporation) considerably improves the strategy's performance; for the portfolio we execute, it outperforms the multiasset version of Almgren¡VChriss by approximately 4¡V4.5 basis points."
"We provide a general and tractable framework under which all multiple yield curve modeling approaches based on affine processes, be it short rate, Libor market, or Heath¡VJarrow¡VMorton modeling, can be consolidated. We model a numeraire process and multiplicative spreads between Libor rates and simply compounded overnight indexed swap rates as functions of an underlying affine process. Besides allowing for ordered spreads and an exact fit to the initially observed term structures, this general framework leads to tractable valuation formulas for caplets and swaptions and embeds all existing multicurve affine models. The proposed approach also gives rise to new developments, such as a short rate type model driven by a Wishart process, for which we derive a closed<U+2010>form pricing formula for caplets. The empirical performance of two specifications of our framework is illustrated by calibration to market data."
"We develop a general framework for statically hedging and pricing European<U+2010>style options with nonstandard terminal payoffs, which can be applied to mixed static¡Vdynamic and semistatic hedges for many path<U+2010>dependent exotic options including variance swaps and barrier options. The goal is achieved by separating the hedging and pricing problems to obtain replicating strategies. Once prices have been obtained for a set of basis payoffs, the pricing and hedging of financial securities with arbitrary payoff functions is accomplished by computing a set of ¡§hedge coefficients¡¨ for that security. This method is particularly well suited for pricing baskets of options simultaneously, and is robust to discontinuities of payoffs. In addition, the method enables a systematic comparison of the value of a payoff (or portfolio) across a set of competing model specifications with implications for security design."
"Bernard, He, Yan, and Zhou (Mathematical Finance, 25(1), 154¡V186) studied an optimal insurance design problem where an individual's preference is of the rank<U+2010>dependent utility (RDU) type, and show that in general an optimal contract covers both large and small losses. However, their results suffer from the unrealistic assumption that the random loss has no atom, as well as a problem of moral hazard that provides incentives for the insured to falsely report the actual loss. This paper addresses these setbacks by removing the nonatomic assumption, and by exogenously imposing the ¡§incentive compatibility¡¨ constraint that both indemnity function and insured's retention function are increasing with respect to the loss. We characterize the optimal solutions via calculus of variations, and then apply the result to obtain explicitly expressed contracts for problems with Yaari's dual criterion and general RDU. Finally, we use numerical examples to compare the results between ours and Bernard et al."
"It has been recently shown that rough volatility models, where the volatility is driven by a fractional Brownian motion with small Hurst parameter, provide very relevant dynamics in order to reproduce the behavior of both historical and implied volatilities. However, due to the non<U+2010>Markovian nature of the fractional Brownian motion, they raise new issues when it comes to derivatives pricing. Using an original link between nearly unstable Hawkes processes and fractional volatility models, we compute the characteristic function of the log<U+2010>price in rough Heston models. In the classical Heston model, the characteristic function is expressed in terms of the solution of a Riccati equation. Here, we show that rough Heston models exhibit quite a similar structure, the Riccati equation being replaced by a fractional Riccati equation."
"Recent empirical studies suggest that the volatility of an underlying price process may have correlations that decay slowly under certain market conditions. In this paper, the volatility is modeled as a stationary process with long<U+2010>range correlation properties in order to capture such a situation, and we consider European option pricing. This means that the volatility process is neither a Markov process nor a martingale. However, by exploiting the fact that the price process is still a semimartingale and accordingly using the martingale method, we can obtain an analytical expression for the option price in the regime where the volatility process is fast mean reverting. The volatility process is modeled as a smooth and bounded function of a fractional Ornstein¡VUhlenbeck process. We give the expression for the implied volatility, which has a fractional term structure."
"The paper studies derivative asset analysis in structural credit risk models where the asset value of the firm is not fully observable. It is shown that in order to determine the price dynamics of traded securities, one needs to solve a stochastic filtering problem for the asset value. We transform this problem to a filtering problem for a stopped diffusion process and apply results from the filtering literature to this problem. In this way, we obtain an stochastic partial differential equation characterization for the filter density. Moreover, we characterize the default intensity under incomplete information and determine the price dynamics of traded securities. Armed with these results, we study derivative assets in our setup: We explain how the model can be applied to the pricing of options on traded assets and we discuss dynamic hedging and model calibration. The paper closes with a small simulation study."
"Financial models are studied where each asset may potentially lose value relative to any other. Conditioning on nondevaluation, each asset can serve as proper numeraire and classical valuation rules can be formulated. It is shown when and how these local valuation rules can be aggregated to obtain global arbitrage<U+2010>free valuation formulas."
"We develop a fixed<U+2010>income portfolio framework capturing the exponential decay of contagious intensities between successive default events. We show that the value function of the control problem is the classical solution to a recursive system of second<U+2010>order uniformly parabolic Hamilton¡VJacobi¡VBellman partial differential equations. We analyze the interplay between risk premia, decay of default intensities, and their volatilities. Our comparative statics analysis finds that the investor chooses to go long only if he is capturing enough risk premia. If the default intensities deteriorate faster, the investor increases the size of his position if he goes short, or reduces the size of his position if he goes long."
"This paper studies a robust continuous<U+2010>time Markowitz portfolio selection problem where the model uncertainty affects the covariance matrix of multiple risky assets. This problem is formulated into a min¡Vmax mean<U+2010>variance problem over a set of nondominated probability measures that is solved by a McKean¡VVlasov dynamic programming approach, which allows us to characterize the solution in terms of a Bellman¡VIsaacs equation in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. We provide explicit solutions for the optimal robust portfolio strategies and illustrate our results in the case of uncertain volatilities and ambiguous correlation between two risky assets. We then derive the robust efficient frontier in closed form, and obtain a lower bound for the Sharpe ratio of any robust efficient portfolio strategy. Finally, we compare the performance of Sharpe ratios for a robust investor and for an investor with a misspecified model."
"This paper considers a non<U+2010>Markov control problem arising in a financial market where asset returns depend on hidden factors. The problem is non<U+2010>Markov because nonlinear filtering is required to make inference on these factors, and hence the associated dynamic program effectively takes the filtering distribution as one of its state variables. This is of significant difficulty because the filtering distribution is a stochastic probability measure of infinite dimension, and therefore the dynamic program has a state that cannot be differentiated in the traditional sense. This lack of differentiability means that the problem cannot be solved using a Hamilton¡VJacobi¡VBellman equation. This paper will show how the problem can be analyzed and solved using backward stochastic differential equations, with a key tool being the problem's dual formulation."
"When trading incurs proportional costs, leverage can scale an asset's return only up to a maximum multiple, which is sensitive to its volatility and liquidity. In a model with one safe and one risky asset, with constant investment opportunities and proportional costs, we find strategies that maximize long<U+2010>term returns given average volatility. As leverage increases, rising rebalancing costs imply declining Sharpe ratios. Beyond a critical level, even returns decline. Holding the Sharpe ratio constant, higher asset volatility leads to superior returns through lower costs."
"There are two major streams of literature on the modeling of financial bubbles: the strict local martingale framework and the Johansen¡VLedoit¡VSornette (JLS) financial bubble model. Based on a class of models that embeds the JLS model and can exhibit strict local martingale behavior, we clarify the connection between these previously disconnected approaches. While the original JLS model is never a strict local martingale, there are relaxations that can be strict local martingales and that preserve the key assumption of a log<U+2010>periodic power law for the hazard rate of the time of the crash. We then study the optimal investment problem for an investor with constant relative risk aversion in this model. We show that for positive instantaneous expected returns, investors with relative risk aversion above one always ride the bubble."
"We specify a general methodological framework for systemic risk measures via multidimensional acceptance sets and aggregation functions. Existing systemic risk measures can usually be interpreted as the minimal amount of cash needed to secure the system after aggregating individual risks. In contrast, our approach also includes systemic risk measures that can be interpreted as the minimal amount of cash that secures the aggregated system by allocating capital to the single institutions before aggregating the individual risks. An important feature of our approach is the possibility of allocating cash according to the future state of the system (scenario<U+2010>dependent allocation). We also provide conditions that ensure monotonicity, convexity, or quasi<U+2010>convexity of our systemic risk measures."
"We solve the problem of optimal stopping of a Brownian motion subject to the constraint that the stopping time's distribution is a given measure consisting of finitely many atoms. In particular, we show that this problem can be converted to a finite sequence of state<U+2010>constrained optimal control problems with additional states corresponding to the conditional probability of stopping at each possible terminal time. The proof of this correspondence relies on a new variation of the dynamic programming principle for state<U+2010>constrained problems, which avoids measurable selections. We emphasize that distribution constraints lead to novel and interesting mathematical problems on their own, but also demonstrate an application in mathematical finance to model<U+2010>free superhedging with an outlook on volatility."
"This paper introduces a dual problem to study a continuous<U+2010>time consumption and investment problem with incomplete markets and Epstein¡VZin stochastic differential utilities. Duality between the primal and dual problems is established. Consequently, the optimal strategy of this consumption and investment problem is identified without assuming several technical conditions on market models, utility specifications, and agent's admissible strategies. Meanwhile, the minimizer of the dual problem is identified as the utility gradient of the primal value and is economically interpreted as the ¡§least favorable¡¨ completion of the market."
"This article studies the optimal portfolio selection of expected utility<U+2010>maximizing investors who must also manage their market<U+2010>risk exposures. The risk is measured by a so<U+2010>called weighted value<U+2010>at<U+2010>risk (WVaR) risk measure, which is a generalization of both value<U+2010>at<U+2010>risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). The feasibility, well<U+2010>posedness, and existence of the optimal solution are examined. We obtain the optimal solution (when it exists) and show how risk measures change asset allocation patterns. In particular, we characterize three classes of risk measures: the first class will lead to models that do not admit an optimal solution, the second class can give rise to endogenous portfolio insurance, and the third class, which includes VaR and ES, two popular regulatory risk measures, will allow economic agents to engage in ¡§regulatory capital arbitrage,¡¨ incurring larger losses when losses occur."
"We propose an approach to the valuation of payoffs in general semimartingale models of financial markets where prices are nonnegative. Each asset price can hit 0; we only exclude that this ever happens simultaneously for all assets. We start from two simple, economically motivated axioms, namely, absence of arbitrage (in the sense of NUPBR) and absence of relative arbitrage among all buy<U+2010>and<U+2010>hold strategies (called static efficiency). A valuation process for a payoff is then called semi<U+2010>efficient consistent if the financial market enlarged by that process still satisfies this combination of properties. It turns out that this approach lies in the middle between the extremes of valuing by risk<U+2010>neutral expectation and valuing by absence of arbitrage alone. We show that this always yields put<U+2010>call parity, although put and call values themselves can be nonunique, even for complete markets. We provide general formulas for put and call values in complete markets and show that these are symmetric and that both contain three terms in general. We also show that our approach recovers all the put<U+2010>call parity respecting valuation formulas in the classic theory as special cases, and we explain when and how the different terms in the put and call valuation formulas disappear or simplify. Along the way, we also define and characterize completeness for general semimartingale financial markets and connect this to the classic theory."
"We consider the problem of valuation of American options written on dividend<U+2010>paying assets whose price dynamics follow a multidimensional exponential Levy model. We carefully examine the relation between the option prices, related partial integro<U+2010>differential variational inequalities, and reflected backward stochastic differential equations. In particular, we prove regularity results for the value function and obtain the early exercise premium formula for a broad class of payoff functions."
"Least<U+2010>squares methods enable us to price Bermudan<U+2010>style options by Monte Carlo simulation. They are based on estimating the option continuation value by least<U+2010>squares. We show that the Bermudan price is maximized when this continuation value is estimated near the exercise boundary, which is equivalent to implicitly estimating the optimal exercise boundary by using the value<U+2010>matching condition. Localization is the key difference with respect to global regression methods, but is fundamental for optimal exercise decisions and requires estimation of the continuation value by iterating local least<U+2010>squares (because we estimate and localize the exercise boundary at the same time). In the numerical example, in agreement with this optimality, the new prices or lower bounds (i) improve upon the prices reported by other methods and (ii) are very close to the associated dual upper bounds. We also study the method's convergence."
"The analytical tractability of affine (short rate) models, such as the VasiA ek and the Coxa£á¡§Ingersolla£á¡§Ross (CIR) models, has made them a popular choice for modeling the dynamics of interest rates. However, in order to properly account for the dynamics of real data, these models must exhibit timea£á dependent or even stochastic parameters. This breaks their tractability, and modeling and simulating become an arduous task. We introduce a new class of Heatha£á¡§Jarrowa£á¡§Morton (HJM) models that both fit the dynamics of real market data and remain tractable. We call these models consistent recalibration (CRC) models. CRC models appear as limits of concatenations of forward rate increments, each belonging to a Hulla£á¡§White extended affine factor model with possibly different parameters. That is, we construct HJM models from a£á<U+0153>tangenta£á affine models. We develop a theory for continuous path versions of such models and discuss their numerical implementations within the VasiA ek and CIR frameworks."
"This paper studies the market viability with proportional transaction costs. Instead of requiring the existence of strictly consistent price systems as in the literature, we show that strictly consistent local martingale systems (SCLMS) can successfully serve as the dual elements such that the market viability can be verified. We introduce two weaker notions of no arbitrage conditions on market models named no unbounded profit with bounded risk (NUPBR) and no local arbitrage with bounded portfolios (NLABPs). In particular, we show that the NUPBR and NLABP conditions in the robust sense are equivalent to the existence of SCLMS for general market models. We also discuss the implications for the utility maximization problem."
"In this paper, we present a discretea£á time modeling framework, in which the shape and dynamics of a Limit Order Book (LOB) arise endogenously from an equilibrium between multiple market participants (agents). We use the proposed modeling framework to analyze the effects of trading frequency on market liquidity in a very general setting. In particular, we demonstrate the dual effect of high trading frequency. On the one hand, the higher frequency increases market efficiency, if the agents choose to provide liquidity in equilibrium. On the other hand, it also makes markets more fragile, in the sense that the agents choose to provide liquidity in equilibrium only if they are market neutral (i.e., their beliefs satisfy certain martingale property). Even a very small deviation from market neutrality may cause the agents to stop providing liquidity, if the trading frequency is sufficiently high, which represents an endogenous liquidity crisis (also known as flash crash) in the market. This framework enables us to provide more insight into how such a liquidity crisis unfolds, connecting it to the soa£á called adverse selection effect."
"MijatoviA<U+2021> and Pistorius proposed an efficient Markov chain approximation method for pricing European and barrier options in general onea£á dimensional Markovian models. However, sharp convergence rates of this method for realistic financial payoffs, which are nonsmooth, are rarely available. In this paper, we solve this problem for general onea£á dimensional diffusion models, which play a fundamental role in financial applications. For such models, the Markov chain approximation method is equivalent to the method of lines using the central difference. Our analysis is based on the spectral representation of the exact solution and the approximate solution. By establishing the convergence rate for the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions, we obtain sharp convergence rates for the transition density and the price of options with nonsmooth payoffs. In particular, we show that for calla£á /puta£á type payoffs, convergence is second order, while for digitala£á type payoffs, convergence is generally only first order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification for two wella£á known smoothing techniques that can restore seconda£á order convergence for digitala£á type payoffs and explain oscillations observed in the convergence for options with nonsmooth payoffs. As an extension, we also establish sharp convergence rates for European options for a rich class of Markovian jump models constructed from diffusions via subordination. The theoretical estimates are confirmed using numerical examples."
"This paper studies the expansion of an option price (with bounded Lipschitz payoff) in a stochastic volatility model including a local volatility component. The stochastic volatility is a square root process, which is widely used for modeling the behavior of the variance process (Heston model). The local volatility part is of general form, requiring only appropriate growth and boundedness assumptions. We rigorously establish tight error estimates of our expansions, using Malliavin calculus. The error analysis, which requires a careful treatment because of the lack of weak differentiability of the model, is interesting on its own. Moreover, in the particular case of calla£á¡§put options, we also provide expansions of the Blacka£á¡§Scholes implied volatility that allow to obtain very simple formulas that are fast to compute compared to the Monte Carlo approach and maintain a very competitive accuracy."
"We consider call option prices close to expiry in diffusion models, in an asymptotic regime (a£á<U+0153>moderately out of the moneya£á ) that interpolates between the wella£á studied cases of ata£á thea£á money and outa£á ofa£á thea£á money regimes. First and higher order smalla£á time moderate deviation estimates of call prices and implied volatilities are obtained. The expansions involve only simple expressions of the model parameters, and we show how to calculate them for generic local and stochastic volatility models. Some numerical computations for the Heston model illustrate the accuracy of our results."
"In this work, we introduce the notion of fully incomplete markets. We prove that for these markets, the supera£á replication price coincides with the modela£á free supera£á replication price. Namely, the knowledge of the model does not reduce the supera£á replication price. We provide two families of fully incomplete models: stochastic volatility models and rough volatility models. Moreover, we give several computational examples. Our approach is purely probabilistic."
"In this paper, we introduce the concept of conic martingales. This class refers to stochastic processes that have the martingale property but that evolve within given (possibly timea£á dependent) boundaries. We first review some results about the martingale property of solution to driftless stochastic differential equations. We then provide a simple way to construct and handle such processes. Specific attention is paid to martingales in [0, 1]. One of these martingales proves to be analytically tractable. It is shown that up to shifting and rescaling constants, it is the only martingale (with the trivial constant, Brownian motion, and geometric Brownian motion) having a separable diffusion coefficient I<U+0192>(t,y)=g(t)h(y) and that can be obtained via a timea£á homogeneous mapping of Gaussian diffusions. The approach is exemplified by modeling stochastic conditional survival probabilities in the univariate and bivariate cases."
"We introduce a class of stochastic processes, which we refer to as lyrebirds. These extend a class of stochastic processes, which have recently been coined peacocks, but are more commonly known as processes that are increasing in the convex order. We show how these processes arise naturally in the context of Asian and Australian options and consider further applications, such as the arithmetic average of a Brownian bridge and the average of submartingales, including the case of Asian and Australian options where the underlying features constant elasticity of variance or is of Merton jump diffusion type."
"In this paper, we extend the 3/2 model for VIX studied by Goard and Mazur and introduce the generalized 3/2 and 1/2 classes of volatility processes. Under these models, we study the pricing of European and American VIX options, and for the latter, we obtain an early exercise premium representation using a freea£á boundary approach and local timea£á space calculus. The optimal exercise boundary for the volatility is obtained as the unique solution to an integral equation of Volterra type. We also consider a model mixing these two classes and formulate the corresponding optimal stopping problem in terms of the observed factor process. The price of an American VIX call is then represented by an early exercise premium formula. We show the existence of a pair of optimal exercise boundaries for the factor process and characterize them as the unique solution to a system of integral equations."
"We develop a framework for computing the total valuation adjustment (XVA) of a European claim accounting for funding costs, counterparty credit risk, and collateralization. Based on noa£á arbitrage arguments, we derive backward stochastic differential equations associated with the replicating portfolios of long and short positions in the claim. This leads to the definition of buyer's and seller's XVA, which in turn identify a noa£á arbitrage interval. In the case that borrowing and lending rates coincide, we provide a fully explicit expression for the unique XVA, expressed as a percentage of the price of the traded claim, and for the corresponding replication strategies. In the general case of asymmetric funding, repo, and collateral rates, we study the semilinear partial differential equations characterizing buyer's and seller's XVA and show the existence of a unique classical solution to it. To illustrate our results, we conduct a numerical study demonstrating how funding costs, repo rates, and counterparty risk contribute to determine the total valuation adjustment."
"Bielecki and Rutkowski introduced and studied a generic nonlinear market model, which includes several risky assets, multiple funding accounts, and margin accounts. In this paper, we examine the pricing and hedging of contract from the perspective of both the hedger and the counterparty with arbitrary initial endowments. We derive inequalities for unilateral prices and we study the range of fair bilateral prices. We also examine the positive homogeneity and monotonicity of unilateral prices with respect to the initial endowments. Our study hinges on results from Nie and Rutkowski for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) driven by continuous martingales, but we also derive the pricing partial differential equations (PDEs) for patha£á independent contingent claims of a European style in a Markovian framework."
"In this paper, we consider factor models of the term structure based on a Brownian filtration. We show that the existence of a nondeterministic long rate in a factor model of the term structure implies, as a consequence of the Dybviga£á¡§Ingersolla£á¡§Ross theorem, that the model has an equivalent representation in which one of the state variables is nondecreasing. For twoa£á dimensional factor models, we prove moreover that if the long rate is nondeterministic, the yield curve flattens out, and the factor process is asymptotically nondeterministic, then the term structure is unbounded. Finally, we provide an explicit example of a threea£á dimensional affine factor model with a nondeterministic yet finite long rate in which the volatility of the factor process does not vanish over time."
"This paper provides a rigorous asymptotic analysis of longa£á term growth rates under both proportional and Mortona£á¡§Pliska transaction costs. We consider a general incomplete financial market with an unspanned Markov factor process that includes the Heston stochastic volatility model and the Kima£á¡§Omberg stochastic excess return model as special cases. Using a dynamic programming approach, we determine the leadinga£á order expansions of longa£á term growth rates and explicitly construct strategies that are optimal at the leading order. We further analyze the asymptotic performance of Mortona£á¡§Pliska strategies in settings with proportional transaction costs. We find that the performance of the optimal Mortona£á¡§Pliska strategy is the same as that of the optimal one with costs increased by a factor of 2. Finally, we demonstrate that our strategies are in fact pathwise optimal, in the sense that they maximize the longa£á run growth rate path by path."
"This paper explores a onea£á period model for a firm that finances its operations through debt provided by heterogeneous creditors. Creditors differ in their beliefs about the firm's investment outcomes. We show the existence of Stackelberg equilibria in which the firm holds cash reserves in order to provide incentives for pessimistic creditors to invest in the firm. We find interest rates and cash holdings to be complementary tools for increasing debt capacity. In markets with a high concentration of capital across a small interval of pessimistic creditors or by a few large creditors, cash holdings is the preferred tool to increase the debt capacity of the firm."
"We identify a large class of Orlicz spaces LI|(I<U+00BC>) for which the topology I<U+0192>(LI|(I<U+00BC>),LI|(I<U+00BC>)na<U+02C6><U+00BC>) fails the Ca£á property introduced by Biagini and Frittelli. We also establish a variant of the Ca£á property and use it to prove a wa<U+02C6>¡Xa£á representation theorem for proper convex increasing functionals, satisfying a suitable version of Delbaen's Fatou property, on Orlicz spaces LI|(I<U+00BC>) with limta<U+2020>¡¦a<U+02C6><U+017E>I|(t)t=a<U+02C6><U+017E>. Our results apply, in particular, to risk measures on all Orlicz spaces LI|(P) other than L1(P)."
"The aim of this paper is to put forward a new family of risk measures that could guide investment decisions of private companies. But at the difference of the classical approach of Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath and the subsequent extensions of this model, our risk measures are built to reflect the risk perception of shareholders rather than regulators. Instead of an axiomatic approach, we derive risk measures from the optimal policies of a shareholder valuea£á maximizing company. We study these optimal policies and the related risk measures that we call shareholder risk measures. We emphasize the fact that due to the specific corporate environment, in particular the limited shareholders' liability and the possibility to pay out dividends from cash reserves, these risk measures are not convex. Also, they depend on the specific economic situation of the firm, in particular its current cash level, and thus they are not translation invariant. This paper bridges the gap between two important branches of mathematical finance: risk measures and optimal dividends."
"In this paper, we study the aggregate risk of inhomogeneous risks with dependence uncertainty, evaluated by a generic risk measure. We say that a pair of risk measures is asymptotically equivalent if the ratio of the worsta£á case values of the two risk measures is almost one for the sum of a large number of risks with unknown dependence structure. The study of asymptotic equivalence is particularly important for a pair of a noncoherent risk measure and a coherent risk measure, as the worsta£á case value of a noncoherent risk measure under dependence uncertainty is typically difficult to obtain. The main contribution of this paper is to establish general asymptotic equivalence results for the classes of distortion risk measures and convex risk measures under different mild conditions. The results implicitly suggest that it is only reasonable to implement a coherent risk measure for the aggregation of a large number of risks with uncertainty in the dependence structure, a relevant situation for risk management practice."
"In a new scheme for hedge fund managerial compensation known as the firsta£á loss scheme, a fund manager uses her investment in the fund to cover any fund losses first; by contrast, in the traditional scheme currently used in most US funds, the manager does not cover investors' losses in the fund. We propose a framework based on cumulative prospect theory to compute and compare the trading strategies, fund risk, and managers' and investors' utilities in these two schemes analytically. The model is calibrated to the historical attrition rates of US hedge funds. We find that with reasonable parameter values, both fund managers' and investors' utilities can be improved and fund risk can be reduced simultaneously by replacing the traditional scheme (with 10% internal capital and 20% performance fee) with a firsta£á loss scheme (with 10% firsta£á loss capital and 30% performance fee). When the performance fee in the firsta£á loss scheme is 40% (a current market practice), however, such substitution renders investors worse off."
"We study a robust portfolio optimization problem under model uncertainty for an investor with logarithmic or power utility. The uncertainty is specified by a set of possible LAcvy triplets, that is, possible instantaneous drift, volatility, and jump characteristics of the price process. We show that an optimal investment strategy exists and compute it in semia£á closed form. Moreover, we provide a saddle point analysis describing a worsta£á case model."
"We study the problem of expected utility maximization in a large market, i.e., a market with countably many traded assets. Assuming that agents have von Neumanna£á¡§Morgenstern preferences with stochastic utility function and that consumption occurs according to a stochastic clock, we obtain the a£á<U+0153>usuala£á conclusions of the utility maximization theory. We also give a characterization of the value function in a large market in terms of a sequence of value functions in finitea£á dimensional models."
"We find optimal trading policies for longa£á term investors with constant relative risk aversion and constant investment opportunities, which include one safe asset, liquid risky assets, and an illiquid risky asset trading with proportional costs. Access to liquid assets creates a diversification motive, which reduces illiquid trading, and a hedging motive, which both reduces illiquid trading and increases liquid trading. A further tempering effect depresses the liquid asset's weight when the illiquid asset's weight is close to ideal, to keep it near that level by reducing its volatility. Multiple liquid assets lead to portfolio separation in four funds: the safe asset, the myopic portfolio, the illiquid asset, and its hedging portfolio."
"We provide an extension of the explicit solution of a mixed optimal stoppinga£á¡§optimal stochastic control problem introduced by Henderson and Hobson. The problem examines whether the optimal investment problem on a local martingale financial market is affected by the optimal liquidation of an independent indivisible asset. The indivisible asset process is defined by a homogeneous scalar stochastic differential equation, and the investor's preferences are defined by a general expected utility function. The value function is obtained in explicit form, and we prove the existence of an optimal stoppinga£á¡§investment strategy characterized as the limit of an explicit maximizing strategy. Our approach is based on the standard dynamic programming approach."
"We consider an investor who has access both to a traditional venue and a dark pool for liquidating a position in a single asset. While trade execution is certain on the traditional exchange, she faces linear price impact costs. On the other hand, dark pool orders suffer from adverse selection and trade execution is uncertain. Adverse selection decreases order sizes in the dark pool while it speeds up trading at the exchange. For small orders, it is optimal to avoid the dark pool completely. Adverse selection can prevent profitable rounda£á trip trading strategies that otherwise would arise if permanent price impact were included in the model."
"The two main approaches in credit risk are the structural approach pioneered by Merton and the reduceda£á form framework proposed by Jarrow and Turnbull and by Artzner and Delbaen. The goal of this paper is to provide a unified view on both approaches. This is achieved by studying reduceda£á form approaches under weak assumptions. In particular, we do not assume the global existence of a default intensity and allow default at fixed or predictable times, such as coupon payment dates, with positive probability. In this generalized framework, we study dynamic term structures prone to default risk following the forwarda£á rate approach proposed by Heath, Jarrow, and Morton. It turns out that previously considered models lead to arbitrage possibilities when default can happen at a predictable time. A suitable generalization of the forwarda£á rate approach contains an additional stochastic integral with atoms at predictable times and necessary and sufficient conditions for an appropriate noa£á arbitrage condition are given. For efficient implementations, we develop a new class of affine models that do not satisfy the standard assumption of stochastic continuity. The chosen approach is intimately related to the theory of enlargement of filtrations, for which we provide an example by means of filtering theory where the AzAcma supermartingale contains upward and downward jumps, both at predictable and totally inaccessible stopping times."
"Motivated by the European sovereign debt crisis, we propose a hybrid sovereign default model that combines an accessible part taking into account the evolution of the sovereign solvency and the impact of critical political events, and a totally inaccessible part for the idiosyncratic credit risk. We obtain closeda£á form formulas for the probability that the default occurs at critical political dates in a Markovian setting. Moreover, we introduce a generalized density framework for the hybrid default time and deduce the compensator process of default. Finally, we apply the hybrid model and the generalized density to the valuation of sovereign bonds and explain the significant jumps in longa£á term government bond yields during the sovereign crisis."
"A credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is an adjustment applied to the value of a derivative contract or a portfolio of derivatives to account for counterparty credit risk. Measuring CVA requires combining models of market and credit risk to estimate a counterparty's risk of default together with the market value of exposure to the counterparty at default. Wronga£á way risk refers to the possibility that a counterparty's likelihood of default increases with the market value of the exposure. We develop a method for bounding wronga£á way risk, holding fixed marginal models for market and credit risk and varying the dependence between them. Given simulated paths of the two models, a linear program computes the worsta£á case CVA. We analyze properties of the solution and prove convergence of the estimated bound as the number of paths increases. The worst case can be overly pessimistic, so we extend the procedure by constraining the deviation of the joint model from a baseline reference model. Measuring the deviation through relative entropy leads to a tractable convex optimization problem that can be solved through the iterative proportional fitting procedure. Here, too, we prove convergence of the resulting estimate of the penalized worsta£á case CVA and the joint distribution that attains it. We consider extensions with additional constraints and illustrate the method with examples."
"The wella£á known theorem of Dybvig, Ingersoll, and Ross shows that the long zeroa£á coupon rate can never fall. This result, which, although undoubtedly correct, has been regarded by many as surprising, stems from the implicit assumption that the longa£á term discount function has an exponential tail. We revisit the problem in the setting of modern interest rate theory, and show that if the long a£á<U+0153>simplea£á interest rate (or Libor rate) is finite, then this rate (unlike the zeroa£á coupon rate) acts viably as a state variable, the value of which can fluctuate randomly in line with other economic indicators. New interest rate models are constructed, under this hypothesis and certain generalizations thereof, that illustrate explicitly the good asymptotic behavior of the resulting discount bond systems. The conditions necessary for the existence of such a£á<U+0153>hyperbolica£á and a£á<U+0153>generalized hyperbolica£á long rates are those of soa£á called social discounting, which allow for longa£á term cash flows to be treated as broadly a£á<U+0153>just as importanta£á as those of the short or medium term. As a consequence, we are able to provide a consistent arbitragea£á free valuation framework for the costa£á benefit analysis and risk management of longa£á term social projects, such as those associated with sustainable energy, resource conservation, and climate change."
"We study utility indifference prices and optimal purchasing quantities for a nontraded contingent claim in an incomplete semimartingale market with vanishing hedging errors. We make connections with the theory of large deviations. We concentrate on sequences of semicomplete markets where in the nth market, the claim Bn admits the decomposition Bn=Dn+Yn. Here, Dn is replicable by trading in the underlying assets Sn, but Yn is independent of Sn. Under broad conditions, we may assume that Yn vanishes in accordance with a large deviations principle (LDP) as n grows. In this setting, for an exponential investor, we identify the limit of the average indifference price pn(qn), for qn units of Bn, as na<U+2020>¡¦a<U+02C6><U+017E>. We show that if |qn|a<U+2020>¡¦a<U+02C6><U+017E>, the limiting price typically differs from the price obtained by assuming bounded positions supn|qn|"
"We consider a general locala£á stochastic volatility model and an investor with exponential utility. For a Europeana£á style contingent claim, whose payoff may depend on either a traded or nontraded asset, we derive an explicit approximation for both the buyer's and seller's indifference prices. For European calls on a traded asset, we translate indifference prices into an explicit approximation of the buyer's and seller's implied volatility surfaces. For European claims on a nontraded asset, we establish rigorous error bounds for the indifference price approximation. Finally, we implement our indifference price and implied volatility approximations in two examples."
"We study the cost of shocks, that is, jump risk, with respect to reserve management when the reserve process is formulated as a drifta£á switching jump diffusion with a reflecting barrier at 0. Inspired by the Brownian drift switching model, our model results in a more realistic dynamic behavior of international reserves than the buffer stock model. The new model can capture both the jump behavior in reserve dynamics and the leptokurtic feature of the increment distribution which has a higher peak and two asymmetric heavier tails than the normal distribution. Through the selection of an initial distribution that reflects certain steady state behaviors, the reserve process becomes a regenerative process. This selection enables us to derive a closeda£á form expression for the total expected discounted cost of managing reserves, thus helping us to numerically find management strategies that minimize costs. The numerical results show that shocks at the reserve level have a significant effect on reserve management strategies and that model misspecification can result in nonnegligible additional costs."
"We analyze the convergence of the Longstaffa£á¡§Schwartz algorithm relying on only a single set of independent Monte Carlo sample paths that is repeatedly reused for all exercise timea£á steps. We prove new estimates on the stochastic component of the error of this algorithm whenever the approximation architecture is any uniformly bounded set of L2 functions of finite Vapnika£á¡§Chervonenkis dimension (VCa£á dimension), but in particular need not necessarily be either convex or closed. We also establish new overall error estimates, incorporating bounds on the approximation error as well, for certain nonlinear, nonconvex sets of neural networks."

"We consider the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FTAP) and hedging prices of options under non-dominated model uncertainty and portfolio constrains in discrete time. We first show that no arbitrage holds if and only if there exists some family of probability measures such that any admissible portfolio value process is a local super-martingale under these measures. We also get the non-dominated optional decomposition with constraints. From this decomposition, we get duality of the super-hedging prices of European options, as well as the sub- and super-hedging prices of American options. Finally, we get the FTAP and duality of super-hedging prices in a market where stocks are traded dynamically and options are traded statically.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"We consider an asset whose risk-neutral dynamics are described by a general class of local-stochastic volatility models and derive a family of asymptotic expansions for European-style option prices and implied volatilities. Our implied volatility expansions are explicit; they do not require any special functions nor do they require numerical integration. To illustrate the accuracy and versatility of our method, we implement it under five different model dynamics: CEV local volatility, quadratic local volatility, Heston stochastic volatility, $3/2$ stochastic volatility, and SABR local-stochastic volatility.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"We study a problem of optimal investment/consumption over an infinite horizon in a market consisting of two possibly correlated assets: one liquid and one illiquid. The liquid asset is observed and can be traded continuously, while the illiquid one can be traded only at discrete random times corresponding to the jumps of a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$, is observed at the trading dates, and is partially observed between two different trading dates. The problem is a nonstandard mixed discrete/continuous optimal control problem which we face by the dynamic programming approach. When the utility has a general form we prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the HJB equation and, assuming sufficient regularity of the value function, we give a verification theorem that describes the optimal investment strategies for the illiquid asset. In the case of power utility, we prove the regularity of the value function needed to apply the verification theorem, providing the complete theoretical solution of the problem. This allows us to perform numerical simulation, so to analyze the impact of time illiquidity in this mixed market and how this impact is affected by the degree of observation.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"We consider the portfolio choice problem for a long-run investor in a general continuous semimartingale model. We suggest to use path-wise growth optimality as the decision criterion and encode preferences through restrictions on the class of admissible wealth processes. Specifically, the investor is only interested in strategies which satisfy a given linear drawdown constraint. The paper introduces the numeraire property through the notion of expected relative return and shows that drawdown-constrained strategies with the numeraire property exist and are unique, but may depend on the financial planning horizon. However, when sampled at the times of its maximum and asymptotically as the time-horizon becomes distant, the drawdown-constrained numeraire portfolio is given explicitly through a model-independent transformation of the unconstrained numeraire portfolio. Further, it is established that the asymptotically growth-optimal strategy is obtained as limit of numeraire strategies on finite horizons.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"We develop two novel approaches to solving for the Laplace transform of a time-changed stochastic process. We discard the standard assumption that the background process (Xt) is Levy. Maintaining the assumption that the business clock (Tt) and the background process are independent, we develop two different series solutions for the Laplace transform of the time-changed process X-tildet=X(Tt). In fact, our methods apply not only to Laplace transforms, but more generically to expectations of smooth functions of random time. We apply the methods to introduce stochastic time change to the standard class of default intensity models of credit risk, and show that stochastic time-change has a very large effect on the pricing of deep out-of-the-money options on credit default swaps.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"The classical literature on optimal liquidation, rooted in Almgren-Chriss models, tackles the optimal liquidation problem using a trade-off between market impact and price risk. Therefore, it only answers the general question of the optimal liquidation rhythm. The very question of the actual way to proceed with liquidation is then rarely dealt with. Our model, that incorporates both price risk and non-execution risk, is an attempt to tackle this question using limit orders. The very general framework we propose to model liquidation generalizes the existing literature on optimal posting of limit orders. We consider a risk-adverse agent whereas the model of Bayraktar and Ludkovski only tackles the case of a risk-neutral one. We consider very general functional forms for the execution process intensity, whereas Gu\'eant et al. is restricted to exponential intensity. Eventually, we link the execution cost function of Almgren-Chriss models to the intensity function in our model, providing then a way to see Almgren-Chriss models as a limit of ours.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"It is commonly believed that the trading of futures on a commodity enables the market to overcome short selling constraints on the spot commodity itself. This belief is embedded in the notion that trading strategies involving futures contracts enable traders to replicate the payoffs as if they were short the spot commodity. The purpose of this paper is to investigate this common belief in a general arbitrage-free semimartingale financial model with trading in futures and a short selling prohibition on the spot commodity. We show via various examples that, in general, this common belief is incorrect. Furthermore, we provide a set of sufficient conditions, albeit very restrictive, under which the common belief is true.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"We consider a framework for solving optimal liquidation problems in limit order books. In particular, order arrivals are modeled as a point process whose intensity depends on the liquidation price. We set up a stochastic control problem in which the goal is to maximize the expected revenue from liquidating the entire position held. We solve this optimal liquidation problem for power-law and exponential-decay order book models and discuss several extensions. We also consider the continuous selling (or fluid) limit when the trading units are ever smaller and the intensity is ever larger. This limit provides an analytical approximation to the value function and the optimal solution. Using techniques from viscosity solutions we show that the discrete state problem and its optimal solution converge to the corresponding quantities in the continuous selling limit uniformly on compacts.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"
"In financial markets, liquidity is not constant over time but exhibits strong seasonal patterns. In this article we consider a limit order book model that allows for time-dependent, deterministic depth and resilience of the book and determine optimal portfolio liquidation strategies. In a first model variant, we propose a trading dependent spread that increases when market orders are matched against the order book. In this model no price manipulation occurs and the optimal strategy is of the wait region - buy region type often encountered in singular control problems. In a second model, we assume that there is no spread in the order book. Under this assumption we find that price manipulation can occur, depending on the model parameters. Even in the absence of classical price manipulation there may be transaction triggered price manipulation. In specific cases, we can state the optimal strategy in closed form.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"We consider evaluation methods for payoffs with an inherent financial risk as encountered for instance for portfolios held by pension funds and insurance companies. Pricing such payoffs in a way consistent to market prices typically involves combining actuarial techniques with methods from mathematical finance. We propose to extend standard actuarial principles by a new market-consistent evaluation procedure which we call `two step market evaluation.' This procedure preserves the structure of standard evaluation techniques and has many other appealing properties. We give a complete axiomatic characterization for two step market evaluations. We show further that in a dynamic setting with a continuous stock prices process every evaluation which is time-consistent and market-consistent is a two step market evaluation. We also give characterization results and examples in terms of g-expectations in a Brownian-Poisson setting.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

"We propose a two<U+2010>sided jump model for credit risk by extending the Leland¡VToft endogenous default model based on the geometric Brownian motion. The model shows that jump risk and endogenous default can have significant impacts on credit spreads, optimal capital structure, and implied volatility of equity options: (1) Jumps and endogenous default can produce a variety of non<U+2010>zero credit spreads, including upward, humped, and downward shapes; interesting enough, the model can even produce, consistent with empirical findings, upward credit spreads for speculative grade bonds. (2) The jump risk leads to much lower optimal debt/equity ratio; in fact, with jump risk, highly risky firms tend to have very little debt. (3) The two<U+2010>sided jumps lead to a variety of shapes for the implied volatility of equity options, even for long maturity options; although in general credit spreads and implied volatility tend to move in the same direction under exogenous default models, this may not be true in presence of endogenous default and jumps. Pricing formulae of credit default swaps and equity default swaps are also given. In terms of mathematical contribution, we give a proof of a version of the ¡§smooth fitting¡¨ principle under the jump model, justifying a conjecture first suggested by Leland and Toft under the Brownian model."
"Constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) allows an investor to limit downside risk while retaining some upside potential by maintaining an exposure to risky assets equal to a constant multiple of the cushion, the difference between the current portfolio value and the guaranteed amount. Whereas in diffusion models with continuous trading, this strategy has no downside risk, in real markets this risk is nonnegligible and grows with the multiplier value. We study the behavior of CPPI strategies in models where the price of the underlying portfolio may experience downward jumps. Our framework leads to analytically tractable expressions for the probability of hitting the floor, the expected loss, and the distribution of losses. This allows to measure the gap risk but also leads to a criterion for adjusting the multiplier based on the investor's risk aversion. Finally, we study the problem of hedging the downside risk of a CPPI strategy using options. The results are applied to a jump<U+2010>diffusion model with parameters estimated from returns series of various assets and indices."
"This paper considers the pricing of corporate securities of a given firm, in particular equity, when investors do not have full information on the firm's asset value. We show that under noisy asset information, the pricing of corporate securities leads to a nonlinear filtering problem. This problem is solved by a Markov chain approximation, leading to an efficient finite<U+2010>dimensional approximative filter for the asset value. We discuss several applications and illustrate our results with a simulation study."
"We investigate the ergodic problem of growth<U+2010>rate maximization under a class of risk constraints in the context of incomplete, Ito<U+2010>process models of financial markets with random ergodic coefficients. Including value<U+2010>at<U+2010>risk, tail<U+2010>value<U+2010>at<U+2010>risk, and limited expected loss, these constraints can be both wealth<U+2010>dependent (relative) and wealth<U+2010>independent (absolute). The optimal policy is shown to exist in an appropriate admissibility class, and can be obtained explicitly by uniform, state<U+2010>dependent scaling down of the unconstrained (Merton) optimal portfolio. This implies that the risk<U+2010>constrained wealth<U+2010>growth optimizer locally behaves like a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) investor, with the relative risk<U+2010>aversion coefficient depending on the current values of the market coefficients."
"It is well known that option valuation problems with multiple<U+2010>state variables are often problematic to solve. When valuing options using lattice<U+2010>type techniques such as finite<U+2010>difference methods, the curse of dimensionality ensures that additional<U+2010>state variables lead to exponential increases in computational effort. Monte Carlo methods are immune from this curse but, despite advances, require a great deal of adaptation to treat early exercise features. Here the multiunderlying asset Black¡VScholes problem, including early exercise, is studied using the tools of singular perturbation analysis. This considerably simplifies the pricing problem by decomposing the multi<U+2010>dimensional problem into a series of lower<U+2010>dimensional problems that are far simpler and faster to solve than the full, high<U+2010>dimensional problem. This paper explains how to apply these singular perturbation techniques and explores the significant efficiency improvement from such an approach."
"We propose a portfolio selection model based on a class of monotone preferences that coincide with mean<U+2010>variance preferences on their domain of monotonicity, but differ where mean<U+2010>variance preferences fail to be monotone and are therefore not economically meaningful. The functional associated with this new class of preferences is the best approximation of the mean<U+2010>variance functional among those which are monotonic. We solve the portfolio selection problem and we derive a monotone version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which has two main features: (i) it is, unlike the standard CAPM model, arbitrage free, (ii) it has empirically testable CAPM<U+2010>like relations. The monotone CAPM has thus a sounder theoretical foundation than the standard CAPM and a comparable empirical tractability."
"We provide equivalence of numerous no<U+2010>free<U+2010>lunch type conditions for financial markets where the asset prices are modeled as exponential Levy processes, under possible convex constraints in the use of investment strategies. The general message is the following: if any kind of free lunch exists in these models it has to be of the most egregious type, generating an increasing wealth. Furthermore, we connect the previous to the existence of the numeraire portfolio, both for its particular expositional clarity in exponential Levy models and as a first step in obtaining analogues of the no<U+2010>free<U+2010>lunch equivalences in general semimartingale models, a task that is taken on in Karatzas and Kardaras (2007)."
