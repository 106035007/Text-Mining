"We model the portfolio decisions by managers with career concerns in a context where ownership of the firm's stock can affect the outcome of promotion contests. In addition to their utility from wealth, such managers derive utility from the monetary and non-monetary benefits (prestige) of running a corporation. Our theory predicts that top managers competing for the CEO position will distort their investment decisions away from the optimum portfolio choice in the absence of career concerns. Thus, our model suggests that changing career opportunities can explain portfolio decisions by managers and that insider ownership can help explain the outcomes of promotion contests. Our main testable predictions are that higher ownership by insiders increases their chances of being appointed CEO; that lower ownership by inside managers makes outside CEO appointments more likely; and that a lower probability of CEO turnover (and thus reduced promotion opportunities) leads inside managers to reduce their ownership in the firm and/or to leave the company. Using data on managerial ownership surrounding CEO turnover events, we find evidence supporting the predictions of our model. Overall, our main insight is that insider ownership, the outcome of promotion contests, the choice between inside and outside CEO replacements, and executive departure decisions are all related. Nous developpons un modele de choix de portefeuille des gestionnaires dans un environnement ou leurs chances d'etre promu PDG sont liees a leur actionnariat dans l'entreprise. Puisque les gestionnaires valorisent leur nomination potentielle au rang de PDG, nous predisons que leur choix de portefeuille sera biaise par rapport au choix qu'ils auraient fait en l'absence d'anticipations carrieristes. Notre modele predit que des changements dans les chances d'etre promu expliquent les choix de portefeuille des gestionnaires. En particulier, nous montrons empiriquement qu'un plus grand actionnariat augmente la chance d'e(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)"

" Corporate governance exists for one reason and one reason alone: to ensure that shareholders' values, as informed by knowledgeable agency, are transformed into company performance. To the extent a board fails in this, no matter how many other useful things it accomplishes, it has failed. To the extent it succeeds in this, no matter that it accomplishes nothing else, it has succeeded. The worldwide surge of corporate governance codes, while acting to protect investors, does little to enhance the integrity and effectiveness of the governance process itself. Significant improvement in boards' ability to fulfil their roles as shareholders' agents requires going beyond the codes and today's best practices to develop conceptually coherent governance theory.

" The purpose of the article is to outline some key characteristics of the Swedish corporate governance system and to highlight some of its important historical roots. The ambition is also to relate and compare Sweden in that respect to some other countries. Hopefully, this article will also help the international corporate governance community to better understand some of the Swedish particulars.

" This paper reports research conducted on detailed behavioural information from the UK Non-Executive Director (NED) Awards 2006. The key findings were that outstanding Chairmen have a high level of integrity, showing high ethical standards in their own behaviour, as well as providing a lead on corporate governance matters. They promote investors' confidence and ensure high returns to investors. They spend significant time mentoring, developing and advising their colleagues, are team builders, are empathetic and very effective. They encourage contributions from fellow directors and achieve consensus yet they challenge and probe colleagues, especially the executive directors. They have an acute critical faculty and a critical thinking ability. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" The voice-exit paradigm continues to serve as the framework for debating key issues in UK corporate governance. That paradigm, however, has become an anachronism with the recent changes in the scale and organisational structure of the UK asset management industry. As a result of these changes the \"holding\" and the \"selling\" of shares tend to be mutually inclusive rather than exclusive acts, and the capital market's corporate governance role is now exercised more through the gravitational pull of equity trading than through the medium of hostile takeovers. If the new realities are to be correctly appraised and factored into the corporate governance codes of conduct, the voice-exit paradigm has to be abandoned in favour of an alternative framework that is attuned to these realities. The aim of this paper is to help develop such a framework. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" This paper provides a framework for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of Australian public assets when owned by: (i) a government department, (ii) a State owned corporate body, (iii) private investor's, or (iv) a network of constituents. The framework evaluates the generic characteristics of the four different types of governance architectures by considering their: (i) accountability, (ii) quality of service, (iii) operating costs, (iv) funding (v) cost of finance, and (vi) political outcomes. Network governance introduces distributed: communications, intelligence, decision making, and control which can be used to augment and/or replace the centralised architecture of the other three alternatives. Network governance is identified as a condition precedent for developing self-governance and enriching democracy.

" We analyse the performance of socially responsible investments in the Netherlands. It appears that the financial performance of the various types of socially responsible investments differs considerably. We construct a proxy for mutual funds' CSR policies and use information about the environmental and social impact of activities financed by \"green\" financial institutions. We find preliminary evidence that financial and CSR performance substantially differs per category of financial instrument analysed. In the Netherlands, tax policy significantly affects financial results and the government can affect the CSR impact of some financial instruments too. More coherent and consistent information about CSR is required to establish whether financial and social performance interact.

" This article examines the overall acceptance of the best practice provisions contained in the Dutch corporate governance code and identifies those that receive comparably less agreement among 150 Dutch listed companies in 2004. The findings indicate a high level of compliance with the Code. Moreover, the extent of compliance is positively associated with company size. Provisions related to the remuneration of board members, independence of supervisory board members, and requirements with respect to internal control systems stand out when it comes to non-compliance. In addition, the nature and content of the explanations provided for non-compliance are remarkably similar across companies, which may indicate symbolic compliance with the Code's best practice provisions.

" During the last decade, globalisation and liberalisation of financial markets, changing societal expectations and corporate governance scandals have increased the attention for the fiduciary duties of non-executive directors. In this context, recent corporate governance reform initiatives have emphasised the control task and independence of non-executive directors. However, little attention has been paid to their impact on the external and internal service tasks of non-executive directors. Therefore, this paper investigates how the service tasks of non-executive directors have evolved in the Netherlands. Data on corporate governance at the top-100 listed companies in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2005 show that the emphasis on non-executive directors' external service task has shifted to their internal service task, i.e. from non-executive directors acting as boundary spanners to non-executive directors providing advice and counselling to executive directors. This shift in board responsibilities affects non-executive directors' ability to generate network benefits through board relationships and has implications for non-executive directors' functional requirements.

" We analyse the relation between capital structure, ownership structure, and corporate value for a sample of 1,216 firms from 15 European countries. Our results stress two different conflicts of interest and show the differential role played by the mechanisms of corporate control depending on the legal and institutional environment. In common law countries, as a consequence of the relationships between managers and shareholders, capital structure and managerial ownership are the most effective mechanisms of control. In civil law countries, however, as a consequence of the conflicts between majority and minority shareholders, the ownership concentration and the sharing of control within the firm become crucial. In this scenario, the second reference shareholder plays a critical role in contesting the control of the dominant largest shareholder in order to reduce the extraction of private benefits and improve the firm's performance.

" Using analysts' forecast error and forecast dispersion of firms covered by the I/B/E/S database, this study examines the change in information asymmetry of Korean firms around the financial crisis of 1997. Results show that the information asymmetry of Korean firms is lower after the financial crisis than before, implying that corporate transparency did, in effect, improve with the change in business environment. In addition, this study finds that chaebol firms have higher information asymmetry than non-chaebol firm, and also that the corporate transparency improvement of chaebol firms is not higher than that of non-chaebol firms in the post-crisis period despite the reforms particularly targeted to chaebol firms after the financial crisis.

" This study examines the effects of outside directors' proportion and their social capital on firm value using a sample of 473 large, publicly traded Korean companies from 1998 through 2003. Outside director proportion, which is defined as the ratio of outside directors to the total number of directors of a company, is regarded as a proxy of board independence. Outside director social capital, which is defined as the degree to which outside board members have outside contacts in the external environment, is regarded as a proxy of board's ability to extract valuable resources or information from the environment. It is hypothesised that both the proportion of outside directors to the total directors and outside director social capital will be positively associated with firm value. This study reports strong GLS evidence of the relationship between outside director social capital and firm value but no significant relationship between outside director proportion and firm value.

" We study the relationship between venture capital financing, CEO ownership, compensation structure, and board structures for a group of Australian IPO firms. Results suggest that board structures are influenced by the industry the firm is in, and presence of venture capitalists results in a larger board with a higher number of outside directors. CEOs in non VC-backed firms own a significantly higher fraction of firm shares, and CEO ownership is negatively related to both board size and outside blockholders. VC-backed firms are significantly more likely to disclose information about CEO compensation packages, but the relationship between actual board size and structure and disclosure is insignificant. Finally, we also find that venture capital backing significantly decreases the time to change-in-status for firms, whereby firms cease to exist as independent entities.

" Board characteristics have not been a significant area of study in the IPO literature. We focus on the emerging corporate governance reform in China to investigate the relationship between a range of board characteristics and IPO initial returns and long-term performance. We find evidence that board size is positively related to short-term returns, while in the long-term, a positive relationship exists between performance and the voluntary post-listing separation of the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board. Our long-term results suggest that at least some Chinese listed firms are actively and voluntarily moving toward better governance structures.

" Most research investigating the impact of board leadership structure as a corporate governance mechanism, on corporate performance has focused largely on either the Anglo-American context or the Asian experience and has come up with diverse conclusions. This study sheds light on the extent to which corporate leadership structure affects corporate performance by providing empirical evidence from a sample of Egyptian listed firms. The initial econometric results indicate that CEO duality has no impact on corporate performance. However, when an interaction term between industry type and CEO duality is included in the model, the impact of CEO duality on corporate performance is found to vary across industries, a result that is supportive of both agency theory and stewardship theory. In addition, when firms are categorised according to their financial performance, CEO duality attracts a positive and significant coefficient only when corporate performance is low.

" We document changes in board characteristics in public US firms between 1997 and 2003. We find significant changes in board independence, committee independence, board size, interlocking directorships, director occupation and multiple directorships. Most of the changes occur between 2000 and 2003. In general, these changes appear both in small and large firms. However, changes in board size and in multiple directorships are statistically significant in large firms only. We find weaker trends in the financial stake of independent directors and in separating CEOs from the chairman position. In 2003 many independent directors have small holdings in the firms they direct and CEOs chair around two-thirds of the boards in our sample. Together, these results shed light on the types of board structures that have recently become the norm in US public firms.

" This paper examines the relationship between firm complexity and board of director composition. Utilising the board typology of Baysinger and Zardkoohi (1986 ), we classify board members either as insiders, business experts, support specialists, or community influentials, and examine board composition in relation to firm internal and external complexity. Internal complexity refers to the sophistication of internal work processes (proxied by firm R&D expenditures, and the amount of invested capital), while external complexity relates to the external competitive structure (proxied by the number of business and geographic segments, and industrial leadership). Utilising a random sample of 150 firms drawn from six industries over the 2003-2005 time period, and after classifying 4,408 directors to one of our board categories, multivariate results confirm conjectures that complexity is related to the specific capabilities that each board member brings to the firm. We find that externally complex firms substitute community influentials for insiders. Additionally, internally complex firms have lower levels of community influentials, which are substituted by insiders and support specialists. This study adds to a small but growing literature that examines the economic determinants of board structure ( Boone \"et al.\", 2007 ; Coles \"et al.\", 2005 ; Gillan \"et al.\", 2003 ; Linck \"et al.\", 2005 ), by providing a unique lens in examining board characteristics that goes beyond the traditional insider/independent classification.

" The mutual versus plc debate has now branched out to include discussion of the potential benefits to consumers from alternative organisational forms. This paper investigates whether performance, risk and fee levels differ across mutual and plc ownership groups in the UK unit trust industry. To this end, this paper uses monthly time-series data for UK unit trusts industry for the years 2000 to 2005 and compares recorded performance from a consumer perspective by organisational form. The paper finds some difference between the two organisational groups with respect to the annual management fee charged and risk-exposures, which seem to affect returns of their unit trusts. Consistent with recent studies, such results suggest that diversity of organisational form fosters product variations across UK investment products.

" Some S&P 500 firms have recently formed technology committees at the board-level. This study investigates the corporate governance and firm financial performance implications of the voluntary formation of technology committees by members of the S&P 500. Using financial performance and structure-related variables, the results of the study suggest that firms' corporate governance ratings are significantly and positively related to their decisions to voluntarily form technology committees. Specifically, firm performance ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, and net profit margin appear to be associated with firms' decisions to form board-level technology committees. These findings have post Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance and performance implications and should be relevant for stakeholders such as the SEC, various stock exchanges, and the firms themselves.

" This paper explores the role of the annual general meeting (AGM) in the mediation of tensions between the board of directors of a company and its shareholders. An evaluative framework is developed for assessing whether directors at any particular AGM appear to be making the meeting inclusive for the shareholders. Consideration is made at first of the place of the AGM as a corporate governance device, concluding that in recent times shareholder voting on resolutions and questioning of the board exhibit important features of self-governance as opposed to external regulation. A scoring system is then developed for assessing whether an AGM favours the company or the shareholders, using twelve criteria to rank them. The results of observations of 22 AGMs over recent years in five industrial sectors are then analysed and assessed, with reasons for high and low scores being suggested.

" The dichotomous worlds hypothesis holds that corporate governance systems worldwide are either based on the Anglo-American shareholder model or the Eurasian stakeholder model. We suggest a more fine-grained classification, based on five corporate governance logics - socially constructed, historical patterns of material practices, assumptions, values, beliefs, and rules by which all parties involved in economic productive activities structure their material interdependencies and provide meaning to the social reality of corporate life. These logics are discovered through a content analysis of the corporate governance reform codes of 38 countries.

" In this study, we assert and test that the determination of corporate performance communication and financial analysts' earnings forecasting work are closely intertwined processes. The resulting endogeneity in capital markets' information dissemination and use is strongly influenced by a country's governance regime. Results from simultaneous equation regressions show significant interrelationships between financial analysts' activities and corporate disclosure transparency for North American firms. Moreover, analyst following underlies corporate disclosure, which ultimately leads to a reduction in the dispersion of analysts' earnings forecasts. In contrast, capital markets' information dynamics for continental European firms are much weaker. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" This paper analyses international location decisions of corporations based on corporate governance considerations. Using firm level data on 540 Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) with 44,149 subsidiaries in 188 countries, we test whether firms with relatively good governance standards are more often located in countries with a weak governance system. We find empirical support for this hypothesis, especially for those corporations present in low-income countries.

" In this study, we explore what kinds of family firms are more likely to have a family CEO or professional CEO, and investigate the performance of CEOs from different backgrounds. The results show that firms with low requirements in managerial skills and a high potential for expropriation are more likely to choose a CEO from the controlling family (nepotism). Our investigation, furthermore, shows that when a firm requires high managerial skills, using a professional CEO can help firm performance, especially if the family has low cash-flow rights and weak control. When there is large opportunity for expropriation in a family firm, the firm's performance will be better if the CEO is a family member and the family has highly persuasive cash-flow rights.

" This paper explores the relationship between directors' pay and performance within Australian banking, using panel data for the 1992-2005 period. The relationship between CEO pay and performance is investigated also. Several earnings models are estimated, using different dependent variables, alternate measures of performance and different estimation techniques. The results indicate an absence of a contemporaneous relationship between directors' pay and bank performance, and no association with prior year performance. However, there is a more distant pay-performance relationship, with total directors' pay having a robust positive association with earnings per share lagged two years, as well as with ROE lagged two years. The other key determinants of directors' pay in Australian banking are bank specific managerial policies, lags in the administration of pay, bank size, directors' age and directors' stock ownership. In contrast to total directors' pay, the evidence confirms a strong positive and direct association between CEO remuneration and prior year bank performance. The pay-performance association is stronger and more direct for CEO remuneration than it is for total directors' remuneration. The responsiveness of CEO pay with respect to bank performance appears to have increased over time. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" Research on the efficacy of stock-based compensation for outside directors has documented a weak or non-existent relationship with firm performance. Other variables also influence the relationships between these two constructs. Consistent with agency theory, we show, for a sample of 450 Standard & Poor 500 firms over the 1995-97 period that the use of director stock options and grants ratios was more strongly associated with positive performance in firms with (a) higher investment opportunities, and (b) weaker external monitoring. These findings have implications for compensation committees in the structuring of director compensation. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" The purpose of this paper is to analyse the relationship between the likelihood that a company will receive a qualified audit report (as a measure of the quality of financial information) and the existence and characteristics of the audit committee (AC). For listed companies that voluntarily created an AC in the period following the publication in 1998 of the Spanish Code of Corporate Governance, known as the Olivencia Code, we find that ACs size, the percentage of independent members in ACs, company size, losses reported in either or both of the previous two years, receiving the same qualified audit opinion as in the previous year and ownership concentration affect the likelihood of receiving error or non-compliance qualifications. However, the existence of an AC and its composition are not factors associated with the receipt of audit reports containing uncertainties or scope limitations, while losses reported in either or both of the previous two years and receiving the same qualified opinion as in the previous year are.

" We test whether corporate governance mechanisms promoted by best practice codes are effective in constraining earnings manipulation for a Spanish sample of quoted companies during the period 1999-2001. In particular, we analyse the association between earnings management and two key aspects of corporate governance: board composition and the existence of board monitoring committees. Our results show that board composition significantly determines earnings manipulation practices. However, the main role in constraining such practices is not played by independent directors, as UK and US based research suggests, but by institutional directors. No correlation is found between the existence of an independent audit committee and earnings management measures. Finally, the existence and composition of a nomination committee affects the role of independent directors in constraining earnings manipulation.

" Recent high-profile corporate failures in the US and elsewhere in the world, many of which were caused by, or at least exacerbated by, weak governance practices, have convinced an increasing number of once sceptical investors that governance is a separate risk class that certainly requires attention and, in many cases, expert analysis. In this paper we examine corporate governance in Tunisia, North Africa, by analysing the board, the ownership structures and the financial market. By using a panel data set of 24 firms listed on the Tunisian Stock Exchange for the period 2000 to 2005, we provide evidence that governance in Tunisian firms is characterised by strong blockholders (often including families). Moreover, firms can choose between a dual board and a monist board. Our estimates show that Tunisian governance is weak. Finally we provide evidence for a strong relationship between governance and corporate performance. Copyright (c) 2007 The Author; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" The National Australia Bank (NAB), one of Australia's largest banks, announced losses in 2004 of AUD$360 million due to unauthorised foreign currency trading activities by four employees who incurred and deceptively concealed the losses. The NAB had in place risk limits and supervision to prevent trading desks ever reaching positions of this magnitude. However, the risk management policies and procedures proved ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the deceit, via a content analysis of official investigative reports and other published documents, to determine the extent to which the Bank's culture and leadership may have influenced the rogue traders' behaviour. The findings suggest that cultural issues, and the role played by the Bank's leaders, were influential in creating a profit-driven culture that ultimately impacted the Bank's foreign exchange operating activities.

" This paper investigates empirically the effect of board ownership on firm performance in Bangladesh. By estimating single equation and simultaneous equation models on an unbalanced pooled sample of listed firms, it offers some new insight into the ownership-performance link in Bangladesh. Building on extant literature, it examines the ownership-performance relationship in an emerging market economy considering ownership as exogenous and as endogenous. The latter approach is favoured as recent empirical evidence shows that ownership and performance are endogenously determined and there is either a reverse-way or two-way causality relationship between the two. While OLS regression analysis indicates a linear and non-linear relationship between board ownership and performance, this disappears when 2-SLS estimation of a simultaneous equation model is carried out. Instead, a reverse causality relationship emerges. Other governance and control variables appear to have effects consistent with the literature. These results suggest a need to strengthen the internal control mechanisms within listed firms in Bangladesh. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" We value UK executive stock options (ESOs) as American options that are awarded conditional on the probability of the holders achieving some performance criteria. Unlike the standard Black and Scholes (BS) model, which is universally used both in the literature and practice, this provides a more realistic representation of UK ESOs. We show that UK ESOs actually have less value and contain more incentives than they appear under the BS approach. Specifically, we observe a 17 per cent average discount in the value of the ESOs when compared to their BS value. In addition, we find significantly higher incentive levels when we measure the sensitivity of the options using the hedge ratio, i.e. the option's delta. We argue that these findings have implications for two contemporary debates in the UK, i.e. the substitution of ESOs by Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) and the discounting of ESO value from company profits.

" This paper reports interview-based research examining reasons for the continued increase in executive directors' remuneration in large UK companies. This issue has not specifically been addressed by previous studies, which have focused on the level of the increases, rather than their underlying explanations. Reasons given for making changes included: increases due to being below-market; changing performance-related schemes that did not pay out or paid less than expected; changes in the company's culture or strategy; changes to senior personnel; and compliance with good practice in human resource management and in corporate governance. The results are analysed through two theoretical lenses. Agency theory provides an explanation of the structure of the contracts; expectancy theory suggests why schemes might be changed to motivate the executives.

" This paper focuses on the corporate governance reforms in Malaysia since the 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis. Drawing upon ten in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with leading players who were highly involved in Malaysia's corporate governance development, together with a review of the literature in this area, the paper offers evidence on the meaning of corporate governance in the Malaysian context, the factors behind the recent reforms and views on the appropriate corporate governance system for Malaysia. While it is shown that Malaysia's corporate governance reforms has modelled on the Anglo-American systems to a large extent, the majority of the interviewees placed greater emphasis on the social aspect of corporate governance in contrast to the traditional notion of shareholder accountability. The main concern raised in the paper is that without changes in the previous problematic corporate culture, the intended purpose of the recent corporate governance reforms will unlikely to be achieved.

" To evaluate the Chinese government's recent market-orientated efforts to promote good corporate governance, this paper conducts a re-examination of the working mechanics for market competition and other market-based governance mechanisms to ensure good corporate governance. The finding is that the utility of market mechanisms may have been exaggerated. Not only are they not effective in disciplining serious managerial misbehaviour that offers managers more gain than loss, even their limited value to discourage such misbehaviour as managerial shirking is conditioned on that the opportunities for illegitimate enrichment by managers are few. On the contrary, legal sanction is fundamental to good corporate governance, because it is the only feasible way to combat such serious misbehaviour and curb illegitimate enrichment. Current experience of corporate governance in China conforms to this finding and poor corporate governance in China is better explained by the lack of credible legal deterrence. This being the case, the top priority for China is to strengthen legal sanction in order to rein in the excessive misappropriation and flagrant fraud. Only once this has been done will the efforts to implement market-orientated reforms bear any significant fruits.

" This study analyses the relationship between ownership structure and board of director composition and their influences on the total factor productivity (TFP) of Taiwan's firms. The empirical results show that the curvilinear specification is better to capture the relationship between inside ownership and firm productivity. Meanwhile, the ownership structure in a firm indeed affects differences in TFP between conglomerate firms and non-conglomerate firms, high-tech firms and non-high-tech firms, and family-owned firms and non-family-owned firms. Additionally, a smaller board may be less encumbered by bureaucratic problems and more functional and CEO duality may be able to improve productivity. Furthermore, productivity deteriorates with increasing proportion of collateralised shares. More institutional holdings, however, are an effective way to alleviate the negative impact of collateralised shares on TFP.

" To understand the evolving perspectives and behaviour of directors and institutional investors, field research was conducted in 2004-2005 by way of a survey with corporate directors in four countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States; n &equals; 658) and institutional investors in Canada (n &equals; 34). Reported changes in directors' views and practices are substantial and consistent across countries, the defining characteristic of which is a fundamental shift in the positioning of the board toward becoming a strategic partner to management. The role of institutional investors also shifted in ways that are complementary to this new role of directors (e.g., toward increased monitoring). While most research has focused on agency concepts of the board as monitors of management, our research suggests that the board is evolving towards a more collaborative role with management, consistent with stewardship theory. Our findings also suggest that directors are seeking a balance between collaboration and their role as monitors of management, rejecting the notion of the board as primarily a monitoring body. An evolutionary model is offered to explain these changes and implications are discussed. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" It is often argued that Black-Scholes (1973 ) values overstate the subjective value of stock options granted to risk-averse and under-diversified executives. We construct a \"representative\" Swiss executive and extend the certainty-equivalence approach presented by Hall and Murphy (2002) to assess the value-cost wedge of executive stock options. Even with low coefficients of relative risk aversion, the discount can be above 50 per cent compared to the Black-Scholes values. Regression analysis reveals that the equilibrium level of executive compensation is explained by economic determinant variables such as firm size and growth opportunities, whereas the pay-for-performance sensitivity remains largely unexplained. Firms with larger boards of directors pay higher wages, indicating potentially unresolved agency conflicts. We reject the hypothesis that cross-sectional differences in the amount of executive pay vanish when risk-adjusted values are used as the dependent variable.

" Using a sample of S&P 1500 firms between 1997 and 2000, this paper examines the effects of outside directors' stock-option compensation on firms' R&D intensity. Results suggest that including stock options in outside directors' compensation enhances firms' R&D. Moreover, stock-option compensation moderates the relationship between board composition and R&D intensity. These results suggest that outside directors' compensation schemes do matter. The results also highlight the need to re-evaluate previous findings that addressed the effects of board composition on both firms' performance and strategic decisions.

" Using data from 3,638 Spanish firms between 1996 and 2000, this article studies the relationship between the presence of large shareholders in the ownership structure of firms and R&D investment. Consistent with our theoretical contention, our results indicate that the impact of large shareholders on the R&D investment is (1) negative when blockholders are banks, (2) positive when blockholders are non-financial corporations and (3) null when blockholders are individuals. In addition, we find a systematic negative relationship between the number of blockholders and R&D investment. Finally, we extend our study by analysing the influence that the combined effect between blockholder type and R&D investment has on the firm's economic performance. Results of this work provide relevant implications for policy makers and academic research. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" Although \"board process\" has been identified as a critical element for future corporate governance research, gaining access to corporate boardrooms is extremely difficult if not virtually impossible for most researchers. This study attempts to address this important issue in the research methodology used to study boards. Rather than discussing the research results of the particular study however, we focus on those impediments that were faced in gaining access to boards of directors, and how these impediments were overcome. Obtaining such access included the utilisation of several non-traditional routes. The study concludes with implications for future corporate governance research.

" In this paper we analyse boards of directors as workgroups, i.e. groups of people that perform one or more tasks within an organisational context. Building on previous studies, we developed a model that relates group's social-psychological processes to three different board tasks: service, monitoring and networking. We tested our model through a survey on 301 large manufacturing firms in Italy. Our findings support the idea that (a) process variables and, to a limited extent, demographic variables significantly influence board task performance; (b) board processes have a different impact on each specific board task; (c) board task performance varies depending upon firm and industry characteristics.

" Recent US corporate governance reforms introduced extensive regulations and guidelines for public corporations, particularly corporate boards. This article evaluates the extent to which empirical research on corporate boards and firm performance supports these reforms. Building on the meta-analysis conducted by Zahra and Pearce (1989 ), we review 105 studies published between 1989 and 2005. We find most of the practices mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the regulations issued by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ, had not been subject to prior study. Where board characteristics have been studied, we find limited guidance for policymakers on identifying governance practices that result in more effective firm performance. In an effort to increase the relevance of future research on boards and firm performance, we provide a framework on corporate boards.

" There is a considerable volume of research on the effects of ownership structure on firm performance. However, the empirical results in this field are often conflicting and inconsistent. A meta-analysis based on 33 studies allows an integration of the results on the association between insider ownership, ownership concentration and firm performance. The findings show that governance system, measurement of performance, and control for endogeneity moderate the effect of ownership on firm performance.

" Audit committees (AC) and the internal audit function (IAF) are two key corporate governance mechanisms. The primary objective of this study is to provide insights into internal auditors' perceptions of their interactions with AC members in Malaysia. The paper thus contributes to the extant literature by providing additional evidence from a South-east Asian country which is recognised as being characterised with a high power distance culture and a developing capital market. The findings are based on in-depth interviews of the heads of the internal audit function (HIAFs) from 11 publicly listed companies. The results indicate infrequent informal communications and limited private meetings between the HIAFs and ACs, and a need for clear reporting lines. Further, ACs are seen to be held in high esteem for their authority and are expected to take on greater leadership in the inquiry of management's decision-making. These findings highlight the importance of the leadership role of ACs in supporting the IAF. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" This paper examines the factors that affect the activity of the audit committees in Spain. The data used in the analyses are collected from the Spanish stock market in 2003. The results show the existence of a non-linear relationship between the managerial stock ownership and the activity of the audit committee. We have also verified the existence of a lower audit committee's activity in highly leveraged firms and when the ownership structure is concentrated in the hands of large shareholders. The large firms have more active committees than small firms. Finally, we have not found any evidence of a significant influence of the composition of the board or the audit committee on the activity of the latter.

" This paper presents the results of a longitudinal complete member researcher participant observer study of two nonprofit association boards with particular reference to their internal corporate governance processes. In doing so, it offers one of the very few available insider observational studies of boardroom behaviour currently available in the management literature. Its inductive analysis reveals boards that proactively manage director recruitment and selection, board member terms and rotation, with a strong emphasis on board membership diversity and representation. A clear progression from informal to formal processes of board and director performance evaluation are observed, and a variability in board-CEO relationships is explored. Agenda structuring changes are observed to directly impact upon strategy and policy focus, while informality and humour emerge as key weapons in the maintenance of cohesion in an increasingly business-oriented environment. Boardroom culture emerges as a potent ingredient in the governance process, thereby signalling its future importance for both researchers and board chairs.

" Boards of large UK companies are devoting more time to the governance of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This is in line with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance's requirement that boards set standards and values for companies and ensure they meet their social obligations. But is board activity in this area as effective as it could be at achieving corporate compliance with CSR standards? This paper draws on the economic literature to offer an analysis of the primary causes of breaches of corporate responsibility standards. Based on a small survey of the board CSR activities of 20 of Britain's largest companies, it assesses whether boards are addressing these causes effectively. The tentative conclusion is that board activity might usefully be reoriented to do more to address the fundamental incentives problems that often cause corporate responsibility failures, namely market failure and misaligned performance management systems.

" The development of best practice recommendations by the Corporate Governance Council (CGC) of the Australian Stock Exchange in 2003 clearly linked corporate regulators' concerns about good governance to the concept of corporate social and environmental responsibility. The CGC recommended that one way to demonstrate good governance was to use the annual report to disclose information to all legitimate stakeholders. This paper reports on the quantity and categories of environmental information disclosed in the corporate annual reports of 41 Australian companies across eight industry groups covering the period 1983-2003. This time period has seen the importance of good corporate governance practice in relation to environmental protection escalate, as demonstrated by the introduction of separate environmental and sustainability reports, the advent of triple bottom line reporting, changes in environmental legislation and the occurrence of major environmental incidents. The results of this study indicate that an increasing number of companies are disclosing environmental information, and the relative volume of such information in annual reports is increasing across all categories.

" Given the pivotal role of banks in modern economies, the worldwide phenomenon of a high level of bank M&A activity and the consensus view in empirical studies that bank mergers destroy value for acquiring bank shareholders, it is highly surprising that the influence of corporate governance on the outcomes of bank acquisitions has received very little academic scrutiny. The recent wave of consolidation in the financial services industry, with its generally unfavourable wealth implications for the shareholders of acquiring institutions, points to the impact of poor bank governance structures. Moreover, the banking sector warrants a separate agency analysis because it is unusual, if not unique, in terms of the opaque nature of many of its main activities and in terms of the pervasive role of regulation in the industry. Both of these attributes may weaken well-established monitoring mechanisms as safeguards of shareholder interests.

" Corporate vote-buying has received significant attention in the last decade, in several legal cases that illustrate the fine line between legitimate use of vote harnessing as a useful corporate strategic tool on one hand, and its negative connotations as a potential instrument of fraud that attempts to disfranchise shareholders on the other hand. After a brief outline of the legal history of corporate vote-buying and the rationale for the courts' vigilance on this practice, in both the United States and the United Kingdom, we outline some strategic reasons for vote-buying that might make it a useful option in certain circumstances. Lastly we discuss key principles that a board of directors should bear in mind when engaging in corporate vote-buying, so that it can employ the practice productively and legitimately, keeping in mind shareholders' best interests and avoiding potentially costly and destructive legal challenges.

" The rapidly increasing worldwide focus on corporate governance has resulted in a proliferation of rating systems that proxy for governance quality. This study develops a governance rating for Greek listed companies by benchmarking their governance structures against three levels: (a) the minimum requirements under Greek regulation (lower level); (b) the incremental recommendations of the Greek code (middle level); and (c) the additional international best practices, prescribed by the UK Combined Code (higher level). Using available data on 274 out of 340 Greek listed companies in 2003 and based on information collected primarily from annual reports, we find that the average governance rating at the lower level is 65.5 per cent; this scoring reduces significantly as we move to the middle and higher level. The average governance rating is 44 per cent. Second, governance scores increase with firm size. Although there may be good reasons explaining these patterns, we find that Greek companies do not provide explanations, i.e. do not practice the \"comply or explain\" recommendation. Third, our middle level aggregate governance rating is much lower than that reported by prior research that uses a different data gathering and weighting approach. This divergence has important methodological implications. Finally, we document a relatively high lack of transparency in relation to Greek governance practices. This is a sign of \"bad governance\".

" This paper studies the impacts of corporate governance on earnings management. We use firm-level governance data, taken from Credit Lyonnais Security Asia (CLSA), of nine Asian countries, in addition to the country-level governance data used in past studies. Our conclusion is as follows. First, firms with good corporate governance tend to conduct less earnings management. Second, there is a \"size effect\" for earnings smoothing, that is, large size firms are prone to conduct earnings smoothing, but good corporate governance can mitigate the effect on average. Third, there is a turning point for \"leverage effect\", i.e. when the governance index is large, \"leverage effect\" exists, otherwise \"reverse leverage effect\" exists. It shows that a highly leveraged firm with poor governance is prone to be scrutinised closely and thus finds it harder to fool the market by manipulating earnings. Fourth, firms with higher growth (lower earnings yield) are prone to engage in earnings smoothing and earnings aggressiveness, but good corporate governance can mitigate the effect. Finally, firms in stronger anti-director rights countries tend to exhibit stronger earnings smoothing. This counter-intuitive result is different from Leuz \"et al\". (2003).

" This paper analyses the effect of the Spanish privatisation process on the performance and corporate governance of the firms that were privatised through public offerings over the 1985-2003 period. Using conventional pre- versus post-privatisation comparisons, we do not find significant improvements in privatised firms' profitability and efficiency. However, our results do suggest a change in firms' ownership structure and in the characteristics of Boards of Directors after privatisation. Firms' ownership concentration decreases as a consequence of the relinquishment of control by the State and the Boards of Directors are restructured with the creation of new specialised committees and the incorporation of more executives.

" We analyse the changes in ownership concentration in firms included in two mass privatisation programmes in Poland and the Czech Republic. We find that despite important differences in the design of the two privatisation schemes and despite different quality of regulatory environments, the ownership structure emerging 4-5 years after the initial distribution of assets is remarkably similar in the two countries. Ownership concentration defined as the share of the largest equity holder has significantly increased. Exploring the determinants of ownership concentration, we check whether such revealed preference for higher participation in firm equity does not hide different motivations and behaviour of investors. Our results reveal interesting differences between the two countries: in the Czech Republic the increase in ownership concentration was less likely in poorly performing firms, while in Poland the quality of past performance did not affect investors' willingness to increase their holdings. This contrasting result may reflect the difference in the quality of laws and regulations in Poland and in the Czech Republic. In the Czech Republic, where tunnelling was a common practice in the period covered by our study, shareholders increasing their stakes in a company could have been motivated by the objective of extracting value rather than by the willingness to impose a specific direction on the way the firm is managed. This might explain why they prefer to increase their control in those companies which perform well rather than those that perform poorly.

" The objective of this study is to investigate further the interplay between market globalisation and corporate governance practices. The study is conducted in Canada using a sample of 230 firms listed on the TSX in 2002 and ranked by Report on Business (ROB ) on a set of corporate governance best practices. The ROB corporate governance index is built around four categories, namely board composition, compensation, shareholder rights and disclosure. The interaction of the sample companies with the US markets is analysed on the three following dimensions: financial market, product market and multi-markets (combining financial, product and labour markets). Overall, our results show that greater US market interaction is associated with higher corporate governance ratings.

" For a sample of 210 Swiss publicly listed firms we analyse the characteristics of all 1678 directors in the year 2003 in order to investigate how board members' nationality and gender interact with directors' level of independence, number of other directorships and demographic characteristics. Our results suggest that whereas foreign directors tend to be more independent, women directors are more likely to be affiliated to firm management through family ties and that foreign directors hold significantly lower numbers of directorships at other Swiss boards. Female and foreign directors also differ in terms of educational background, educational level, age and board tenure. Some of our gender diversity findings are different from previous research. We conclude that in order to manage diversity on corporate boards it is imperative to understand the characteristics, qualifications and affiliations that these directors bring to the boardroom and that it is important to take national circumstances into account rather than relying on research results from other countries.

" This study examines participation of African-Americans on the boards and board committees of the US Fortune 500. Prior work suggests the use of committee assignment to discern active versus figurehead involvement on boards. We use a logistic regression model that controls for director traits, firm characteristics and director resource-dependence roles to compare the odds that a black director will be assigned to key committees to those for a white director. We find that black directors are more (less) likely than whites to sit on audit and public affairs (executive) committees. Black female directors are more likely than both white females and black males to serve on finance committees. Thus there is some evidence that race plays a role in determining assignment to corporate board committees. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" While corporate governance research has had some success tying boards' demographic characteristics to relatively distant outcomes such as CEO pay and succession, numerous studies have indicated that a major weakness of this research is that it has largely ignored the intervening behaviours associated with board vigilance. This study begins to answer this call by examining the relationship between boards' demographic characteristics and boards' information-gathering behaviour. Using primary and secondary data from 149 firms, this study finds that an increase in the proportion of outside directors on a board is associated with an increase in boards' information quality and proactive information-seeking. In addition, an increase in outside director tenure is associated with boards exchanging information more frequently. Consistent with agency theory predictions, these findings suggest that vigilant boards are likely to take actions aimed at reducing the level of information asymmetry between them and their CEOs.

" We examine hypothesised links between the board of directors and firm performance as predicted by the three predominant theories in corporate governance research, namely agency theory, stewardship theory and resource dependence theory. By employing a pattern matching analysis of seven cases, we are able to examine the hypothesised link between board demography and firm performance expected under each theory. We find that while each theory can explain a particular case, no single theory explains the general pattern of results. We conclude by endorsing recent calls for a more process-orientated approach to both theory and empirical analysis if we are to understand how boards add value.

" Board evaluations can contribute to effective boards and improved corporate financial performance. The increasing interest in the practice of board evaluations, however, calls for a more systematic and careful approach than has been employed in the past. While most attention has primarily been focused on the content of board evaluations, this article outlines the features of various possible board evaluation systems. Based on state-of-the-art research on boards and governance, we contend that a comprehensive board evaluation system needs to include decisions about: (a) the agent who evaluates the board; (b) the content, or what the evaluation should deal with; (c) the addressee and other stakeholders for whom the board is evaluated; and (d) how the board is evaluated. These key decisions should not be seen as independent of each other as they have consequences for the kind of system that will be adopted. Following this argument, we present four different board evaluation systems: (i) board-to-board, (ii) board-to-market, (iii) market-to-board and (iv) market-to-market. The key message we communicate in this article is that there must be a fit between the purpose and the system of board evaluations. There is no universal or \"one best way\" to evaluate boards of directors. Board evaluations will not meet their purpose unless there is a fit between the agents, the addressees, the content and the modalities of the evaluation. It is important to know who is doing what for whom and how. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" We investigate the impact of board's quality as defined by a Score published in a Canadian National Newspaper on the performance of the firm. Based on the current literature, we ranked the boards of 219 Canadian firms in terms of four board characteristics: composition of the board, compensation of board members, shareholder rights, and disclosure. Then, we defined firm performance by using traditional accounting-based measures such as ROI, ROE, EPS, and Market-to-book ratio and value creation-based measures such as EVA(R) and MVA. To test the effects of board's quality on firm performance, we adopted different models of univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.

" Theoretically and empirically, the linkage between outside directors and firm performance is not conclusive in previous studies. We suspect that the mixed results are due to the failure to meet the requirements of the independence of outside directors. As the Taiwanese government has a rigorous definition of outside director independence, we employ a data set from Taiwan to test the impact of independent outside director assignment on a firm's performance. Our findings suggest that after controlling for a firm's past performance, independent outside director appointments do have a significantly positive impact on a firm's performance, and outperforming firms may have better performance but not significantly when assigning outside directors due to their absorptive capacity.

" This paper sets out to investigate the effects of disclosure, and other corporate governance mechanisms, on equity liquidity, arguing that those companies adopting poor information transparency and disclosure practices will experience serious information asymmetry. Since poor corporate governance leads to greater information asymmetry, liquidity providers will incur relatively higher adverse information risks and will therefore offer higher information asymmetry components in their effective bid-ask spreads. The Transparency and Disclosure (T&D) rankings of the individual stocks on the S&P 500 index are employed to examine whether firms with greater T&D rankings have lower information asymmetry components and lower stock spreads. Our results reveal that the economic costs of equity liquidity, i.e. the effective spread and the quoted half-spread, are greater for those companies with poor information transparency and disclosure practices.

" This paper examines the association between the quality of voluntary earnings forecasts, as measured by forecast bias and accuracy reviewed by an incumbent CPAs, and the purchase of non-audit services (NAS) from the incumbent auditor. In the context of this study, we focus primarily on the Taiwanese market. Unlike in the UK and US, management forecasts must be reviewed by the incumbent CPA in Taiwan. Besides, enforcement of rules with regard to the provision of review-level assurance for management earnings forecasts tends to be less stringent than one of audit-level assurance for financial reporting. Using panel data of audit and non-audit fees available for Taiwanese firms, we find that firms with a high ratio of NAS tend to issue more optimistically biased and inaccurate forecasts under a lower auditor liability regime. These results provide some support for concerns expressed about the potential impact of unusually high levels of NAS on auditor independence and ultimately, the quality of audited financial reports. The findings also suggest that examining the auditor, and in particular, the provision of non-audit services, in isolation of an institutional environment provides an incomplete analysis of financial reporting.

" In this paper we use panel data methodology to examine the relationship between ownership structure, discretionary accruals and the informativeness of earnings for a sample of Spanish non-financial companies listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange during the period 1999-2002. We find a non-linear relationship between insider ownership and discretionary accruals and between insider ownership and earnings explanatory power for returns. This supports the hypothesis that insider ownership contributes both to the informativeness of earnings and to constraining earnings management when the proportion of shares held by insiders is not too high. When insiders own a large percentage of shares, however, they are entrenched and the relation between insider ownership, discretionary accruals and earnings informativeness reverses.

" \"Pay Without Performance: The Unfilled Promise of Executive Compensation\" by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried (Harvard University Press, 2004) challenges the view that executive remuneration arrangements are designed to maximise shareholder value. The authors argue that managerial power results in remuneration being structured to benefit executives at the expense of shareholders. This paper contends that Bebchuk and Fried's approach illustrates issues that contribute to the problematic nature of executive remuneration research. In particular, it is proposed that a priori conceptions about executive remuneration, methodological dogmatism in research approaches and a significant gap between theory and practice, each contribute to the lack of convergence in executive pay research. Illustrative data taken from interview-based research conducted with Australian non-executive directors supports the view that reliance on economic efficiency arguments alone does not provide a sufficient framework to explain the subjective, judgemental and socially interactive processes involved in determining executive pay.

" This special issue of \"Corporate Governance\" is devoted to the concept of \"universal ownership\" (UO) and grows out of a conference of universal owners, institutional investors, investment professionals and academics held in April 2006 at Saint Mary's College of California, under the sponsorship of the Center for the Study of Fiduciary Capitalism (A report of the conference is available at http://www.fidcap.org ). Four of the seven articles in this issue are based on papers presented at the conference, while an additional three (by Lydenberg, Syse and Gjessing, and Lippman \"et al.\") were written specifically for this issue. The conference purposefully developed a practitioners' perspective on universal ownership and these articles reflect this orientation, although each article in its own way breaks new ground which academics, policy researchers and practitioners can and should develop.

" This paper introduces a new measure, based on a study by Trucost and Dr Robert Repetto, combining external environmental costs with established measures of economic value added, and demonstrates how this measure can be incorporated into financial analysis. We propose that external environmental costs are relevant to all investors: universal investors are concerned about the scale of external costs whether or not regulations to internalise them are likely; mainstream investors need to understand external costs as an indication of future regulatory compliance costs; and SRI investors need to evaluate companies on both financial and social performance. The paper illustrates our new measure with data from US electric utilities and illustrates how the environmental exposures of different fund managers and portfolios can be compared. With such measures fund managers can understand and control portfolio-wide environmental risks, demonstrate their environmental credentials quantitatively and objectively and compete for the increasing number of investment mandates that have an environmental component.

" How useful are universal owner arguments for a large, diversified investor such as Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM)? This article presents concrete issues, such as climate change and corruption, which can be analysed using universal owner arguments. However, it also discusses potential weaknesses of this argumentative strategy. The article includes a general background to Norway's Government Pension Fund Global - now one of the world's largest funds - and concludes that such a fund could utilise universal owner insights in its work as an active owner by (1) addressing both companies and standard setters on issues of portfolio-wide, long-term importance; (2) respecting a division of labour between different actors in the market place; and (3) taking part in collaborative arrangements, both within organised networks and informally between investors.

" Changes in prescription drug prices have broad ripple effects across the diverse portfolios that most institutional investors hold. Lower prices cut into pharmaceutical company profits, but improve the overall productivity and profitability of other investable sectors of the economy. This paper considers the net impact of cuts in drug prices on investor portfolios. We find that falls in pharmaceutical company profits resulting from price cuts would be largely if not fully offset by a combination of health plan cost-savings and increases in consumer spending power. Furthermore, falling drug prices benefit investors through the dynamic benefits from a healthier workforce with greater access to prescription drugs. We conclude that, from the perspective of the broadly diversified \"universal investor\", support for lower drug prices is consistent with a fiduciary duty to seek attractive long-term returns at the portfolio level. Strategies for shareholder activism should be expanded, including engagement with corporate health care purchasers and advocacy for public policy reform.

" This paper posits three types of investors in today's financial markets: Universal Investors, Social Investors and Rational Investors. It argues that the Universal and Social Investor are theoretically inclined to seek returns that benefit society and the environment as a whole, while the tenets of modern portfolio theory lead the Rational Investor to seek returns based primarily on market price. Because of the dominance of modern portfolio theory, the actual practices of the Universal and Social Investor reproduce those of the Rational Investor in most regards today. However, Universal and Social Investors are now pioneering at least three investment practices that promote returns to the economy and society. These are engagement with corporate management, investments that benefit underserved communities, and the setting of social and environmental standards in selecting investments. These practices differ from those of the mainstream in that they deliberately take into account more than market price in seeking returns on investments.

" ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues represent both a \"tragedy of the commons\" and a golden opportunity for a positive system change. Universal Owners should recognise both their power and their responsibilities, and then to leverage their investment strategies to catalyse ESG improvements in their investee companies. This can be done through both stock selection and direct engagement with companies. To date, unfortunately, a myriad of largely cognitive barriers have prevented Universal Owners from mobilising their considerable investment power in this way to any significant extent. There is, however, some encouraging evidence that this is beginning to change. Copyright (c) 2007 The Author; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" The modern institutional trustee in its incarnation as majority owner of American business has conflicts of interest of debilitating proportions. Notwithstanding the inveterate and unchanging rigour of trust law requiring the fiduciary to administer assets \"for the exclusive benefit of plan participants\", today's conglomerate - understandably enough in a world where there is no enforcement - persistently favours its own interest in pleasing present and potential customers. There has been no enforcement of breach of fiduciary obligations either by the executive or judicial branches of government. In light of the trend of some courts towards the Law & Economics policy of \"efficient compliance\", there must be some doubt as to whether courts will require compliance with trust law.

" This article presents an analysis of the newly created European company Societas Europaea (SE) focusing on the consequences for European corporate governance. The SE offers the possibility to organise the management of a SE as a one-tier, or alternatively a two-tier, system. It is argued that this flexibility will not result in a single board system prevailing in equilibrium, but instead this choice will be made depending on each firm's business environment. Thus, the SE gives the management the option to incorporate in another member state. As argued, this will, eventually, lay the ground for a European market for incorporations. Important issues such as investor protection and dual-class voting shares are also analysed. The most controversial topic in the creation process of the SE was the role of the employees. The article completes with a discussion of the employees' role in relation to the opponent doctrines of shareholder vs stakeholder value.

" This paper studies the effects of having multiple large shareholders who share the control of firms, by analysing a unique dataset of Italian shareholders' agreements (voting trusts). We investigate the separation between ownership and control granted by such agreements, showing that, on average, a voting trust owning 52 per cent of the total company's cash-flow rights is able to exercise up to 87 per cent of the total board rights; the wedge is particularly beneficial to the largest shareholder within the voting trust who is able to get the majority of board rights despite owning only a minority fraction of the company's cash-flow rights. Then, an event-study analysis of a sample of voting trusts' announcements is performed. The results support the \"entrenchment effects\" hypothesis ( Stulz, 1988 ) linking the ownership structure and the firm value, and are consistent with the view that, in Italy, voting trust agreements are mainly aimed at both protecting controlling shareholders from hostile takeovers and entrenching incumbent management.

" I examine the treatment of minority shareholders and shareholder activism following Olivetti's successful hostile acquisition of a majority stake in Telecom Italia in 1999. Overall, the evidence is mixed. While Olivetti pursued several operations perceived to be detrimental to Telecom Italia's minority shareholders, they were atypically vigorous in fighting back. In several cases, Olivetti was forced to abandon or improve the terms of the operations. While Telecom Italia was vulnerable to a hostile takeover attack following its privatisation, the concentration of ownership of listed companies ensures that hostile takeovers will remain rare. Moreover, low participation rates at annual meetings among small investors serves to enhance the power of the controlling blocks.

" The Berle-Means thesis (1932 \"The Modern Corporation and Private Property\". New York: Harcourt, Brace and World) implies that diffuse ownership adversely affects firm performance. This paper tries to investigate whether there is strong evidence to support the notion that variations across firms in observed ownership structures result in systematic variations in observed firm performance. We test this hypothesis by assessing the impact of the structure of ownership on corporate performance, measured by profitability, using data for 175 Greek listed firms. Following Demsetz and Villalonga (2001 Ownership Structure and Corporate Performance, \"Journal of Corporate Finance\", 7, 209-233), we model ownership structure, first, as an endogenous variable and, second, we consider two different measures of ownership structure reflecting different groups of shareholders with conflicting interests. Empirical findings suggest that a more concentrated ownership structure positively relates to higher firm profitability. We also find that higher firm profitability requires a less diffused ownership. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" The article outlines characteristics of governance of companies owned by municipalities in Sweden and reports on the results of board evaluation of fifteen companies belonging to the city of Stockholm using gap analysis as a method. The contribution of the boards to a corporate governance model proposed in this article and to compliance with a Swedish code of best practice were analysed. Respondents were asked to answer questions about the importance of an issue and to what extent it had been carried out. Separate assessments of the role of the chairs and that of board members were made. Each of them evaluated the contribution of the other. An appraisal of the chair by the CEO was also included. The results show that board members had a good understanding of their duties, but there was a considerable gap with respect to their performance. Functions that are vital to corporate governance - strategy and control - gave low values. Only some board members took an active part in decisions. The boards' task to follow up on terms of references also gave a low rating. The practice of committee work was not established, except for an executive committee. There was a lack of follow up on internal control. The performance of the chairs was evaluated to find clues to low ratings. Self assessment of the chair gave the largest gaps between importance and actual performance on answers regarding board leadership. Board members and CEOs gave the chairs constantly lower values than the chairs gave themselves. The results however indicate differences between boards with regard to their performance. The results can serve as a basis for discussions between chairs and board members about board performance. Implications for boards and for owners of companies are highlighted.

" It is generally believed that poor corporate governance has been the Achilles' heel of many corporations in both rich and poor nations. This is particularly true of Nigeria, where corruption is endemic. However, following the change of government in 1999, the Federal Government is keen to attract foreign investments into the country. Given the high correlation between corporate governance and investor decisions, the government is keen to position the country to take advantage of the opportunities in the global market by adhering to principles of good governance. Yet not much is known about the state of, or the current framework for, corporate governance in Nigeria. By providing a comprehensive review of the state of corporate governance in Africa's most populous country, this paper makes a contribution to the literature on the state of corporate governance in developing countries. The paper examines the mechanism for corporate governance, including the requirements of the recently established Code of Best Practices for Public Companies in Nigeria. In particular, it examines the roles of the government, the Corporate Affairs Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the representatives of the shareholders of the companies, directors, auditors and the Audit Committee in the governance process. The paper addresses the issue of whether the governance mechanisms in Nigeria are adequate in the face of the changes and challenges in the global corporate scene. It argues that whilst there is a case for adherence to global corporate governance standards, any Code of Best Practices adopted in Nigeria must reflect its peculiar socio-political and economic environment, whilst at the same time providing the right assurance to prospective and existing shareholders.

" The board of directors is one of a number of internal governance mechanisms that are intended to ensure that the interests of shareholders and managers are closely aligned, and to discipline or remove ineffective management teams. Among the most significant governance issues currently faced by the modern corporation are those relating to diversity, such as gender and age, and independence of directors.

" Corporate governance is often regarded as a weak link in Asia's company performance. Most studies have focused on the relationship between ownership and firm value, but the instruments that mediate that relationship have often been overlooked. This paper attempts to address this issue by examining the relationship between ownership types and firm performance by analysing variations in governance practices and their impact on firm performance. This paper shows that different types of majority owners exhibit distinct traits of behaviour and preferences for corporate governance practices in an environment of pervasive concentration of shareholding. Such governance practices and various firm characteristics are found to have an impact on firm performance. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

" The contribution of outside directors to firm performance has been shown to be inconsistent. Korean companies first began in 1998 to introduce outside directors to carry out governance reform. This paper analyses the impact of outside directors on corporate performance during the governance reform movement undertaken in Korea in 1999 as well as the moderating effect of the large shareholder and managerial ownership rate. We hypothesised a positive relationship between outside director effectiveness (outside director participation rate) and firm profitability, a negative moderating effect in terms of large shareholder ownership and managerial ownership, and a positive moderating effect when it comes to blockholder ownership. This moderating relationship is considered in order to investigate the role of large shareholders under the Korean governance structure. Our empirical analysis showed that outside directors had a weak positive impact, and that a large shareholder ownership rate and a block shareholder ownership rate moderated this relationship in a negative fashion. The managerial ownership rate did not show any significant moderating effects. We thus conclude that it is too early to assess the impact of outside directors on corporate performance, and that Korean companies exhibit an \"owner-controlled\" governance structure; that is, they are governed by large shareholders who have demonstrated a resistance to attempts to bring about governance reform through such means as the introduction of outside directors. Outside shareholders were found to possess insufficient power to monitor large controlling shareholders. This paper seeks to make a contribution to the field by conducting an analysis of governance structure in Korea in the aftermath of the currency crisis, as well as of outside directors in emerging economies, a subject rarely dealt with in governance studies.

" This paper tests the relationship between ownership/leadership structures and stock returns for firms listed in Taiwan. A \"Governance Index\" is built based on four different aspects of the company's governance structure: 1. CEO duality, 2. Size of the board of directors, 3. Managements' holdings and 4. Block shareholders' holding. This index is used as a proxy measure of the effectiveness of the corporate governance mechanism. We propose that firms under good governance should outperform those under poor governance. We find a striking relationship between our governance index and stock performance of firms. The results imply that our corporate governance index is successful in evaluating the effectiveness of the governance mechanism of firms in Taiwan.

" We propose that the extent to which regulation and competitiveness play a role in the country environment has a complex, interactive effect on the relationship between corporate governance and firm performance. Using an analytical method, we develop an algorithm to express these effects, and offer proofs to show that our algorithm meets central conditions that are identified based on extant research findings in this domain. An illustration traces the performance of firms with different corporate governance standards across various environmental conditions.

" According to Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, Singapore has the best corporate governance practices in Asia. Malaysia has had the biggest improvements in governance overtime. Thailand lags behind both in achieving appropriate governance. This paper considers recent developments in corporate governance through the analysis of the corporate websites of financial corporations in these countries. The study finds that the corporate governance practices of Thai, Malaysian and Singaporean financial corporations are consistent with international best practices. Corporate governance as presented in company documents probably does not actually reflect real corporate governance practices. These practices do not have an impact on company performance. The level of corporate governance reported is also not consistent with the ratings from international financial institutions such as Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia and Standard & Poor's. These findings suggest that corporate governance in ASEAN is more illusion than fact. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" China has reformed its enforcement mechanisms of accounting practices, in particular, corporate governance, in order to facilitate the harmonisation of Chinese accounting practices with IFRS practices. However, this research reveals that the reformed corporate governance has not made a significant contribution towards this harmonisation. The move of Chinese accounting practices towards IFRS practices is mainly due to the CSRC's 2001 compulsory harmonisation policy of eliminating the earnings gap. Corporate governance as an important enforcement mechanism for accounting standards has yet to be effective. Copyright (c) 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" Many studies discuss convergence of cross-border governance and governance-related disclosure practices, but provide little empirical evidence to support their arguments and analysis. Our study examines the governance and disclosure practices of the world's largest transnational firms. Using a unique dataset of 75 large firms in two time periods, 1995 and 2002, we examine both the governance practices, and disclosures regarding those governance practices, across Anglo-Saxon and non-Anglo-Saxon firms. Results indicate that non-Anglo-Saxon firms have developed their governance practices towards promoting an independent mechanism of control, namely a mechanism that is more similar to an Anglo-Saxon governance regime. In regard to governance-related disclosure practices, results indicate that for both Anglo-Saxon and non-Anglo-Saxon groups, disclosure practices have been evolving and converging towards more disclosures regarding governance matters.

" Transnational corporations (TNCs) are driving globalisation, but is there any evidence that the boards who govern these corporations are becoming more global? The question is intriguing to those who study corporate governance and those interested in the sociology of global capitalism, but up to now evidence on the extent of TNC board globalisation is largely anecdotal or weak. To address this issue I conducted a follow-up to Gillies' and Dickinson's (1999 \"Corporate Governance: An International Journal\", 7, 237-247) study of 80 of the world's largest TNCs. These authors reported that in 1993 36.3 per cent of these companies had at least one non-national board member. In late 2005 I found, in contrast, that 75 per cent of these companies had at least one non-national board member. However, the evidence also shows that while this trend has certainly become more widespread, it is not yet very deep; on average, only 25 per cent of these boards consisted of non-nationals, while non-nationals made up a majority of the board in only 10 per cent of these cases. Nevertheless, this trend toward more multinational boards is worth monitoring because such boards provide a transnational social infrastructure which may facilitate the emergence of a global business class.

" Are the risk and control developments in corporate governance changing the role of the external auditor? This paper examines how the concepts of risk and control are incorporated in current corporate governance promulgations and analyses the implications for the role of the external auditor. It is suggested that up till now the corporate governance debate has strengthened the position or role of the internal auditor in the advantage of the role of the external auditor. The promulgations have influenced the internal control mechanisms, and the control responsibilities have become more explicit. Dominant determinants for the future role of the external auditor seem to be in conflict, namely the value adding function of the audit with an alignment of risk oriented efforts by the auditor and the company versus the notion of \"back to basics\". The external auditors ought to recognise that they must be perceived as \"the\" experts regarding internal control and risk management and that this must be engrained as part of the service rendered, i.e. part of the value adding nature of an audit. At the same time they must improve the transparency of the audit standards and the communication processes of audit reporting.

" Theoretical perspectives on organisational governance tend to position boards and top management teams in relationships characterised either as control or collaboration. These perspectives may not take into account the realities faced by organisations needing to undertake changes to meet the demands of turbulent environments. What are the critical roles that boards should play to successfully accomplish organisational change? This study first examines research on organisational change in order to identify critical contributions that boards can make to successful planning and implementation of organisational change. Testable propositions are then presented that suggest roles boards should play in effectively guiding organisational change while protecting the interests of an organisation's stakeholders.

" A new movement reconciling corporate sustainability and investment is gaining world-wide attention. Whether corporate sustainability has an impact on market value is examined using large US non-financial firms from 1999 to 2002 in this paper. Taking Tobin's \"q\" as the proxy for firm value, a significantly positive relation between corporate sustainability and its market value is found. We also find a strong interaction effect between corporate sustainability and sales growth on firm value. Moreover, there is evidence to support that being sustainable causes a firm to increase its value. This indicates that companies with remarkable sustainable development strategies are more likely to be rewarded by investors with a higher valuation in the financial markets.

" Motivated by the ongoing post-Enron refocusing on corporate governance and the shift by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK to promoting compliance-competence within the financial services sector, this paper demonstrates how template analysis can be used as a tool for evaluating compliance-competence. Focusing on the ethical dimension of compliance-competence, we illustrate how this can be subjectively appraised. We propose that this evaluation technique could be utilised as a starting point in informing senior management of corporate governance issues and be used to monitor and demonstrate key compliance and ethical aspects of an institution to external stakeholders and regulators.

" This Australian study seeks to better understand the disparity between the positive attitudes towards Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) and the level of investment in SRI, by examining both the attitudes to SRI and the investment choices that are made. It is hypothesised that those who are more committed to principles of environmental sustainability are more likely to invest in SRI. To test this, 318 people from two large Queensland organisations are surveyed in relation to their investment attitudes and preferences. We find that there are significant differences in investment attitudes with environmentalists placing more importance on SRI investment criteria. However, there was no significant difference between environmentalists and non-environmentalists in terms of utility scores from an investment selection experiment with the environmentalists placing higher importance on financial performance criteria than SRI criteria, making choices similar to those with the lowest level of environmental activism. Furthermore, the observed lack of congruency between attitudes and choices in relation to environmental criteria may have implications for the growth of SRI funds.

" Concepts of social enterprise have been debated repeatedly, and continue to cause confusion. In this paper, a meta-theoretical framework is developed through discussion of individualist and communitarian philosophy. Philosophers from both traditions build social theories that emphasise either consensus (a unitarist outlook) or diversity (a pluralist outlook). The various discourses in corporate governance reflect these assumptions and create four distinct approaches that impact on the relationship between capital and labour. In rejecting the traditional discourse of private enterprise, social enterprises have adopted other approaches to tackle social exclusion, each derived from different underlying beliefs about the purpose of enterprise and the nature of governance. The theoretical framework offers a way to understand the diversity found within the sector, including the newly constituted Community Interest Company (CIC).

" This paper investigates the ethnic and gender diversity of the corporate board of UK companies, placing particular emphasis on links to board size and industry characteristics. We employ a novel dataset that covers a large sample of UK PLCs and describes a director's gender, ethnicity and position held. We find both ethnic and gender diversity to be very limited, and that diversity is somewhat less pronounced among executive positions. We find significant cross-sector variation in gender diversity, with an above average prevalence of women in Retail, Utilities, Media and Banking, while such variation in ethnic diversity is considerably less pronounced. Our evidence suggests that a close proximity to final consumers plays a more significant role in shaping board diversity than does the female presence among the industry's workforce. We argue that this shows that board diversity is influenced by a firm's external business environment and particularly an imperative to reflect corresponding diversity among its customers.

" Board diversity has become a major issue within corporate governance where a number of studies seek to explore the impact of diversity on firm performance. The debate focuses on questions such as whether a corporation's board should reflect the firm's stakeholders or be more in line with society in general. This article uses a sample of listed Danish firms during the period of 1998-2001 in a cross sectional analysis. Despite that fact that Denmark has gone very far in the liberalisation of women, Danish board rooms are still to a large extent dominated by men. Contrary to a number of other studies, this article does not find any significant link between firm performance as measured by Tobin's Q and female board representation. This is also the case for board members' educational background as well as the proportion of foreigners. It is argued that board members with an unconventional background are socialised unconsciously adopting the ideas of the majority of conventional board members, which entails that a potential performance effect does not materialise.

" A growing literature discusses the convergence of national systems of corporate governance. Fostering convergence are activist institutional investors, especially from the United States. The following is a case study of one institutional investor - the giant pension fund, CalPERS - and its efforts to change governance in Japan over the past 15 years. CalPERS' involvement in Japan went through three stages: solo activism; cultivation of local partners; and, most recently, a shift from marketwide activism to company-level relational investing. Although CalPERS has had some success in changing Japanese corporate governance, economic and political factors have limited its influence and permitted the persistence of Japan's distinctive governance system.

" Livedoor's attempted takeover of Nippon Broadcasting System in February 2005 marked a watershed in the history of mergers and acquisitions in Japan. The drama was played out in public, changing popular perceptions, influencing policy makers and sending managers scurrying to debate and erect legitimate defence measures in case they themselves should be targeted. Tensions on the investor relations interface were not subsequently reversed by Livedoor's equally dramatic demise. The article considers the rise of takeover bids in Japan, responses to it, and their significance for corporate control and governance, as well as for the \"community firm\".

" Japanese corporate governance can be analysed in terms of a defining characteristic of \"internalism\": the belief that companies should be controlled by internally appointed managers who are integrated into their firms. Examples are offered from recent contacts with corporate management and other sources to illustrate how this determines the response of management to specific developments. Internalism depends on a socio-corporate environment created by specific historical and economic circumstances. Potentially disruptive elements exist which could alter this environment and undermine the foundations on which internalism rests. However, major change seems unlikely in the near future.

" This paper analyses the impact of CSR initiatives in restructuring processes. It assesses how steps taken by company managers combine with legislative interventions and shareholders' initiatives with a view to promoting workers' rights. It is based on the case study of a Swiss company from the metalworking sector, Tornos, which has been for 20 years in a process of permanent restructuring. First the legal and conventional resources available in Switzerland are listed, then how Tornos mobilised these tools in its situation is analysed. The conclusion summarises the main lessons with regard to the impact of CSR in the Swiss context. Copyright (c) 2007 The Author; Journal compilation (c) 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" In the face of declining prominence and influence under industrial relations laws regulating Australian workplaces, Australian trade unions appear increasingly to be directing their attention to Corporations Law as a mechanism for pursuing union and employee \"voice\" within corporate business organisation. This paper undertakes an examination of four recent \"union shareholder\" campaigns, the circumstances in which they were undertaken, the objectives of the \"union shareholder\" strategies and the outcomes of the campaigns. The paper also opens up for consideration whether union shareholder activism is merely a new strategy for pursuing conventional industrial aims, or whether it potentially represents a move by unions to identify themselves as \"insiders\" with a dual interest in the profitability and governance of the corporation as both shareholders and stakeholders.

" This paper undertakes an examination of the espoused commitment to CSR principles and its relationship with the labour management systems in two Australian mining companies. The paper explores the extent to which the adoption of a CSR strategy has affected the management of labour in three respects: \"collective\" relations with unions; \"partnership-style\" relations with unions and workers; and the adoption of HPWS measures. The paper concludes that while each company has made substantial \"in principle\" commitments as a result of CSR, there is nothing to suggest that CSR considerations are sufficiently powerful in themselves to bring about systemic change in the management of labour.

" We present a model of CSR as a set of mechanisms for aligning corporate behaviour with the interests of society in reducing externalities and promoting a sustainable corporate sector. These mechanisms include voluntary action by companies to go above minimum legal standards, with the aim of enhancing competitiveness (\"action beyond compliance\"); interventions by regulators designed to promote self-regulation by industry (\"reflexive law\"); and steps taken by shareholders to put pressure on companies to make effective use of corporate assets (\"shareholder engagement\"). We then assess the degree to which the model is realised in current British practice. Focusing on the issue of working conditions, we find managerial resistance to the linking of CSR with internal employee relations, and obstacles to shareholder engagement on this issue.

" This article examines the corpus of multinationals' codes of conduct on CSR issues which has been collated by the ILO. Through lexical software analysis we identify three main points of reference in CSR codes of conduct: respect for ILO norms, discussion of the company's relationship to society, and reinforcement of its internal discipline and organisation. Surprisingly, the issue of corporate responsibility itself constitutes a small part of the text of the codes. Their main targets are employees, who are charged with a dual task: to ensure the implementation of the principles stated in the codes, and to protect the assets of the company. In a reflexive dimension, codes of conduct help us to understand the key characteristics of the companies which made them.

" Corporate governance is fundamentally about such questions as what business is for-and in whose interests companies should be run, and how. Wider issues such as business ethics through entire value chains, human rights, bribery and corruption, and climate change are among the great issues of our time that increasingly cross-cut the rarefied worlds of corporate boardrooms. As a result, a growing proportion of SustainAbility's work has seen the fusion of corporate governance with such wider societal concerns. This paper reviews the increasingly complex cross-connects between the rapidly mutating governance agenda and the burgeoning world of corporate responsibility, social entrepreneurship and sustainable development. We will move through three stages: (1) a brief review of work that SustainAbility has done in the area of corporate governance; (2) the three great waves of societal pressure on business since 1960, and where things seem likely to head next; and (3) some headline conclusions that emerged in this field from the World Economic Forum's 2006 annual summit in Davos.

" How many directorships are too many? Globally, normative advice emphasises the importance of limiting the number of directorships any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple directorships as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources. To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple directorships, we first consider the issues related to multiple directorships and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple directorships. We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection. Copyright (c) 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" Over the last few years corporate governance codes and shareholder expectations have increased the need for boards of directors to demonstrate effective leadership, quality decision-making processes and the ability to exercise corporate controls. Shareholders and stakeholders continue to focus on indicators such board structure, composition and non-executive independence as proxies for effectiveness, often without an increased under-standing of the environment in which boards of directors make decisions, or the behaviour and dynamics of individuals. In order specifically to address this issue the Combined Code, published in 2003, stated that a board should undertake annually \"a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance, that of the committees and individual directors\" ( Financial Reporting Council, 2003 , p. 10. The \"Combined Code on Corporate Governance\". London: Financial Reporting Council), although it omitted to give formal guidance on evaluation methods, or the disclosure of outcomes to shareholders.

" The aim of this paper is to discuss and analyse whether recommendations on corporate governance have led to more transparency and well-defined corporate identities for listed small and medium-sized companies through their external communication on corporate governance. The paper focuses on the task and responsibility of the board and discusses the effect of external communication on management, transparency and corporate identity. The paper also analyses results from two empirical studies on communication on corporate governance from 60 Danish listed companies. It can be concluded that communication through corporate governance has led to more transparency in how companies are managed. There is room for improvement, however, before external communication leads to well-defined company identities. Copyright (c) 2006 The Author; Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" While the corporate governance literature generally focuses on the parent legal entity, many organisations are now multinational enterprises (MNEs) with subsidiaries that are most often legal entities in their host countries. Despite the strengthening of corporate governance regimes internationally, the boards of these subsidiaries are in many instances perfunctory. This paper examines the question of whether developments in corporate governance theory and practice can add value for the local subsidiaries of MNEs.

" Reflecting investor expectations, most prior corporate governance research attempts to find a relationship between boards of directors and firm performance. This paper critically examines the premise on which this research is based. An expectations gap approach is applied for the first time to implicit expectations which assume a relationship between firm performance and company boards. An expectations gap has two elements: a reasonableness gap and a performance gap. Seven aspects of boards are identified as leading to a reasonableness gap. Five aspects of boards are identified as leading to a performance gap. The paper concludes by suggesting avenues for empirically testing some of the concepts discussed in this paper.

" Governance of public corporations in the United States has operated under the agency model with regulatory strengthening since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. With this foundation in place, boards are empowered to utilise their power and influence and can effectively monitor the actions of management, intervening where necessary. In effect, the rules of engagement embodied in the structure and the law guide interactions and empowerment. The governance model of the mutual funds industry, representing over 8 trillion dollars, is often viewed as a mirror of the corporate world, but upon closer analysis is found to have significant structural differences that dilute the authority of directors. The two models are compared and analysed with recommendations made to strengthen the oversight of mutual funds. Copyright (c) 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" I argue and found that the effectiveness of a firm's monitoring mechanisms to prevent managerial opportunism in acquisitions becomes more important under high environmental complexity and/or dynamism because of the increased information asymmetry between investors and top executives under these conditions. I also found that increased monitoring under non-complex and/or stable environments may be viewed negatively by investors, and that symbolic information about governance arrangements affects investors' evaluations of managerial opportunism in acquisitions. The results highlight the need for more research on factors that influence the explanatory power of agency theory.

" An experimental study was conducted to measure the impact of \"herding behaviour\" inside a board of directors based on the Gonzalez (2002 PhD dissertation) theoretical model, which maintains that in a board meeting composed of a CEO and two external directors (A and B), where voting is sequential (CEO  A  B) and the directors' reputations are valuable, director B tends to copy director A's decision. Based on the observations made through the experiment, we confirm the presence of herding behaviour. Copyright (c) 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" In this paper, three instruments for empowering small, individual shareholders are compared: proxy investing, proxy voting institutions and infomediaries. The working of each instrument is discussed with special emphasis on the problems of information gathering and coalition forming. Subsequently, each instrument is analysed with respect to appropriateness, costs and effectiveness. No instrument turns out to be clearly superior to the others. Although proxy investing is the most popular concept among small (individual) shareholders at present, the long-run potential of proxy voting institutions and infomediaries may be higher. Since more research could be helpful to establish which of these two options is best, both non-profit organisations and governments could in the meantime stimulate experiments with proxy voting institutions and infomediaries for small shareholders.

" This study extends earlier research on corporate governance by examining whether the information-usefulness of annual accounting earnings varies with the fraction of outside directors serving on the board and board size. Using panel data from New Zealand (NZ) firms for the financial years 1991-97, we find that earnings informativeness is negatively related to board size but is not related to the fraction of outside directors serving on the board. Our results are robust to controlling for various firm-specific factors that are known to be associated with earnings informativeness.

" Since 2002 company law requires listed German corporations to declare their degree of conformity to the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). We examine whether there is a pricing effect connected to the declared degree of compliance for a sample of (big) publicly traded German companies listed in the DAX 30 and MDAX. We find that the degree of compliance with the Code is value-relevant after controlling for an endogeneity bias. This shows that the capital markets find the rules in the code meaningful and that there is capital market pressure to adopt the Code regulation. Our findings also suggest that the capital market fills a possible \"control vacuum\" resulting from the withdrawal of commercial banks from their (former) influential role in the German \"insider control\" corporate governance model.

" This study examines chief executive officer (CEO) compensation and turnover in socially responsible (SR) firms. We compare characteristics of SR firms with a matched sample of firms based on industry and size. Analysis of CEO compensation indicates that the link between CEO pay and firm performance is weaker for SR firms than for non-SR firms. CEO turnover tests indicate that SR firms are more likely to experience CEO turnover following poor performance.

" What are the main differences in expectations between NGOs and companies who interact with each other with respect to corporate social responsibility (CSR)? This is the leading question for a research project within the framework of the Dutch National Research Program on CSR (2003-2004). The research starts with the observation that companies and NGOs are increasingly interacting regarding CSR. Exploring the mutual expectations in the early stages of an interaction can deliver valuable information about the possibilities for cooperation. In order to study these expectations and experiences, a web-based tool is developed. The application of this tool results in the relevant gaps between mutual expectations and the comparison of expectations expressed in the beginning of the interaction with the actual experiences.

" The board of directors is regarded as one of the most imperative governance mechanisms in small and medium-sized family firms. Empirical studies examining both the roles these boards fulfil in a family business context, as well as evaluating the CEO's perceived importance of these roles, are scarce. Founded by a range of conceptual and multi-theoretical board role definitions, this paper contributes to the literature by empirically determining board roles. Furthermore, the importance of these board roles and differences between the board's performance and perceived importance are assessed. The results show it is indispensable to differentiate between two aggregated roles that boards in small and medium-sized family firms perform: control and service. The control role is predominantly based on agency theory, whereas the service role includes multiple theoretical perspectives. The CEOs of the family firms perceive the service role of the board as most important. However, in order to direct succession and to compensate for the owner/manager's altruistic behaviour, the board's control role should not be neglected. The acknowledgement of these two aggregated board roles and their importance may enhance future research on board roles within specific contexts.

" The \"comply or explain\" principle adopted by the UK's Combined Code on Corporate Governance has now been in operation for 12 years. In this paper we focus on two aspects of this regime. The first is the nature of the explanations that have been given by companies with an established record of non-compliance (\"serial non-compliers\") and the role of the market in permitting deviations from the Combined Code. In particular, we consider the significance of share price performance as a factor that is relevant in justifying non-compliance and the extent to which investors appear to rely on this indicator rather than engage in the more difficult task of judging the relative merits of the Code provisions against alternatives. Our approach differs from much of the research linking corporate governance with financial performance in that it focuses on the potential influence of financial performance (as measured by share price) on governance structure rather than vice versa. Our study of FTSE 100 serial non-compliers suggests that there is a \"prima facie \"link between share price performance and investors' tolerance of non-compliance with the Combined Code. The second issue we examine is the link between the principle of \"comply and explain\" and the self-regulatory status of the Code. We conclude that the benefits of flexibility generally associated with the self-regulatory status of the Code are overstated and that the Code could be integrated into mainstream company law.

" There have been a number of changes in United Kingdom corporate governance regulation since the financial scandals of the late 1980s and early 1990s. These developments, commencing with the publication of the Cadbury Report in 1992, address \"the frequency, clarity and form in which information should be provided\" (Cadbury Report, 1992, p. 60). This paper examines the increased flow of corporate news announcements by UK listed companies following the introduction of corporate governance codes. Our results indicate that the introduction of the Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel reports was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of news announcements.

" The recent onslaught of corporate scandals has compelled the world to acknowledge the profound impact of corporate governance practices on the global economy. Corporate governance is of particular concern in developing economies, where the infusion of international investor capital and foreign aid is essential to economic stability and growth. This paper focuses attention on corporate governance initiatives in South Africa, given its significance as an emerging market, its potential leadership role on the African continent and the country's notable corporate governance reform since the collapse of apartheid in 1994. The evolution of the country's corporate structure and the forces driving corporate governance reform over the past decade will be examined, followed by a review of the most notable reform initiatives in place today. Finally, an assessment of those initiatives will be presented, along with recommendations concerning how South Africa's initiatives can serve as models of enhanced corporate governance standards for the African continent.

" Almost all firms start out as small, owner-managed companies. Many stay that way throughout their lives. Some create attractive investment opportunities, however, that will allow them to grow rapidly and become leading companies in their country. These firms typically do not have sufficient internal funds flows and must turn to external sources of finance. Among these is the issuance of equity. Once a firm sells shares, however, the cost of the managers engaging in on-the-job consumption falls, and they can be expected to do so at the expense of their shareholders. Knowing this, potential shareholders may be unwilling to purchase a new offering of a young firm's shares, and the firm with attractive investment opportunities is unable to finance them. Strong corporate governance institutions help to protect shareholders from the discretionary use of their firm's resources. This paper reviews the case for having strong corporate governance institutions to facilitate the creation of thick equity markets in the context of developing countries in emerging markets, and examines the case for relying on alternative sources of capital including the state.

" This paper considers the Greenspan/Summers/IMF (GSI) argument that the Asian way of doing business was the deep cause of the Asian crisis. The IMF reform programme for the crisis-affected Asian countries suggested they should abandon the Asian business model and adopt the US corporate model. The main findings are: (a) contrary to GSI doctrine, poor corporate governance and lack of competition are not common characteristics of the Asian business model; (b) the stock market-based US business model has severe limitations for developing country corporations, not least because of imperfect share prices and the imperfect market for corporate control.

" We survey empirical studies examining privatisation's effects in developing economies. Most of these studies find that privatisation yields improvements in the operating and financial performance of divested firms, and only a handful document outright performance declines after privatisation. Almost all studies that examine post-privatisation changes in output, efficiency, profitability, capital investment spending and leverage document significant increases in the first four measures and significant declines in leverage. The studies examined here are far less unanimous regarding the impact of privatisation on employment levels in privatised firms. Studies that explicitly address the sources of post-privatisation performance improvement using data from multiple non-transition economies tend to find stronger efficiency gains for firms in regulated industries, in firms that restructure operations after privatisation, and in countries providing greater amounts of shareholder protection.

" In this paper, we use a large firm-level dataset covering 19 European countries in order to compare the ownership and financing structures and performance of listed (LCs) and large non-listed companies (NLCs). For the overall sample, we find that the substantial majority of NLCs have either a large or medium blockholder. This contrasts with the ownership structure of LCs, which usually have no large blockholder. Moreover, we present information on typology of large blockholders as well as financial ratios in LCs and NLCs. The results from matched-pairs analysis, employed in order to directly compare the two categories, suggest that NLCs use relatively less fixed assets and they appear to be more capital intensive than LCs. In terms of performance, NLCs have higher returns on assets and equity than LCs do, but lower margins. Overall, the paper contributes to the understanding of differences between NLCs and LCs.

" Recent financial reporting and auditing scandals on both sides of the Atlantic have led to a global realisation of the importance of sound corporate governance (CG) practices in alleviating the agency problems in the corporate form of business and for efficient allocation of capital in international markets. Transparency and disclosure (T&D) practices followed by firms are an important component and a leading indicator of CG quality. Transparent and full-disclosure of information is especially vital for Turkey where external capital is necessary to sustain the high growth rate and the biggest agency problem centres on asymmetric information and expropriation by majority shareholders.

" The objective of this study is to examine the impact of concentrated ownership and business group affiliation on the performance of Turkish firms during the financial crisis by controlling balance sheet currency exposure, international involvement and firm size. Our analysis focuses on a 12-month window encapsulating the February 2001 financial crisis. Our findings show that balance sheet exposure is the key determinant of the firm performance during the crisis periods. While we find evidence that firms with higher concentrated ownership experience lower stock market performance prior and during the financial crisis, business group affiliation does not have any impact on the performance. However, there is weak evidence that stock market performance increases with the level of business group diversification.

" This study highlights the corporate governance potential of debt maturity structure for Turkish firms through investigating its association with ownership and control structure. We model leverage and debt maturity as jointly endogenous under simultaneous equations framework. Firstly, we find that both concentrated ownership structure and presence of a large shareholder is directly but moderately related to corporate debt maturity. We also document that it is important for Turkish firms to match maturity of their assets with maturity of their liabilities. Our findings lend considerable support to the prediction that as firms get financially strong or have more growth opportunities they shorten their corporate debt maturity structure. Moreover, despite having a controlling large shareholder or a concentrated ownership structure, firms with growth opportunities still prefer shorter maturities in order to solve the underinvestment problems. Finally, firm size is positively associated with long-term debt and our empirical analysis provides no evidence that taxes affect debt maturity structure.

" Recent work on corporate governance has highlighted the effects of corporate governance quality on macroeconomic crises, especially in the context of South-East Asian economies. However, the possibility of reverse causation from macroeconomic performance to corporate governance has been overlooked. This paper aims to address this issue by examining the relationship between macroeconomic stabilisation and corporate governance reforms in Turkey since the 1999 and 2001 crises. We demonstrate that the prospect of macroeconomic stability has led to extensive corporate governance reforms for two reasons. First, recent return to macroeconomic stability has been underpinned by public governance reforms, which spilled over to the area of corporate governance. We call this the statutory reform effect. Second, macroeconomic stability tended to have a positive effect on firms' investment in corporate governance quality. We call this the voluntary reform effect. To substantiate these findings, we examine the post-1999 developments in the following areas: (i) the effectiveness of regulatory authorities; (ii) disclosure and transparency rules; and (iii) the quality of the enforcement regime.

" In spite of the fact that most research has concentrated on the typical agency problem between managers and dispersed shareholders, in many countries large shareholders are much more frequently observed than firms with dispersed ownership structures. While large shareholders are perceived as a potential solution to the typical agency problem between managers and dispersed shareholders, less research has been done on the costs of large shareholders. One important issue in this literature is that deviations of cash flow rights from voting rights often result in substantial value discounts. In this paper we test for the impact of such deviations on corporate investment performance in Turkey. To measure corporate investment performance we estimate returns on investment relative to company costs of capital, a methodology that overcomes the endogeneity problem, which is known to contaminate results in the empirical corporate governance literature. Consistent with existing studies, we find that the average Turkish listed company has a return on investment which is less than its cost of capital. We also report significantly better investment performance for companies that do not deviate from one share-one vote by using pyramidal ownership structures, dual-class shares and other devices that enhance the control power of large shareholders beyond their cash flow rights. We also find that business group membership improves the investment performance and relative market valuation of companies.

" This paper argues that key differences between the UK and the US in the importance ascribed to a company's social responsibilities (CSR) reflect differences in the corporate governance arrangements in these two countries. Specifically, we analyse the role of a salient type of owner in the UK and the US, institutional investors, in emphasising firm-level CSR actions. We explore differences between institutional investors in the UK and the US concerning CSR, and draw on a model of instrumental, relational and moral motives to explore why institutional investors in the UK are becoming concerned with firms' social and environmental actions. We conclude with some suggestions for future research in this area. Copyright (c) 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" This paper discusses the findings of a study undertaken by a team from the University of Birmingham's Institute for Local Government Studies (INLOGOV), funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The research explores the implications for democratic practice of collaborative working through partnership arrangements in the public sector. Through a study of multi-organisational partnerships in two local authority areas, the research identifies a problem for policy makers to address: partnerships are flexible management tools, but exhibit a democratic deficit in terms of the rules and procedures of public governance when measured against a benchmark of elected local government. Partnerships are in, but not of, the community. Copyright (c) 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" The paper investigates the Financial Services Authority's (FSA) reforms of the unique corporate governance arrangements of UK life insurers. In particular, the paper explores the need for special arrangements for the governance of with-profits funds, the role of actuaries in corporate governance and the proposals for reform which resulted from the FSA's With Profits Review and Lord Penrose's Report into the problems experienced at the Equitable Life Assurance Company. The paper concludes that post-Cadbury trends in corporate governance, in combination with the FSA's reforms, have placed boards at the centre stage of actuarial governance with directors no longer able to abrogate responsibility for actuarial decisions. There is also much to be learnt from studying changes to the actuarial and corporate governance of life insurers as it reveals the complex nature of corporate reality, and demonstrates the inadequacy of theoretical approaches that dichotomise corporate governance between Anglo-Saxon shareholder and continental European stakeholder models.

" The paper evaluates the characteristics of corporate boards associated with layoff decisions using a large sample of UK firms suffering performance declines over the period 1994-2003. The results show that firms are less likely to respond to performance declines with employee layoffs when they have large boards. Further analysis shows that layoff decisions are positively associated with the proportion of outside directors and directors' remuneration. The findings provide some support to the recommendations of the Cadbury Report (1992) and Higgs Review (2003) on the importance of the structure and composition of board of directors in the corporate governance process.

" Various corporate governance initiatives were adopted in Korea following a major corporate governance failure, identified as a direct cause of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998. Our findings indicate that, before the crisis, the likelihood of replacing poorly performing CEOs was not related to business group (chaebol) affiliation. However, after the Asian Financial Crisis, we find CEO turnover sensitivity to performance is greater in chaebol firms than in stand-alone firms. These findings indicated improved monitoring following reforms initiated by the Korean government, NGOs and other capital market participants. These findings have implications for the effectiveness of corporate governance in US firms following governance restructuring imposed by the SEC, the government and various market participants.

" We analyse the profile of the boards of directors of 142 Brazilian publicly-held companies in 1999. Directors were divided into four distinct categories, following Bhagat and Black (2000 Working Paper no. 143, Columbia Law School) criteria for the US market. Our survey analyses the degree of independence of directors in relation to their respective controlling shareholders. Our results indicate that the controlling shareholders' representatives largely dominate the boards. One intriguing finding is that minority shareholders do not use the mechanisms at their disposal to elect directors. There seems to be low interest by non-controlling shareholders in participating in shareholders' meetings, and consequently in selecting representatives for the board of directors. This could partly be explained by the lack of proxy voting mechanisms. Copyright (c) 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation (c) 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
" There has been considerable research in respect of voluntary disclosure by companies and factors that may explain such disclosure. However, most of the research has been centred in developed countries. This study extends the previous literature by examining voluntary disclosure in a developing country, namely Kenya. Over the last decade, the Kenyan Government has initiated several far-reaching reforms at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) in order to mobilise domestic savings and attract foreign capital investment. These measures include privatisation of state corporations through the stock exchange and allowing foreign investors to own shares in the listed companies. This study provides a longitudinal examination of voluntary disclosure practices in the annual reports of listed companies in Kenya from 1992 to 2001. The study investigates the extent to which corporate governance attributes, ownership structure and company characteristics influence voluntary disclosure practices.

" When the Cyprus economy was booming in the 1990s, key issues emanating from sound corporate governance, such as accountability, transparency and effective independent boards were not deemed important. However, largely as a result of the Cyprus stock exchange collapse of 2000, this view changed. In September 2002, due to the collapse, the Cyprus Stock Exchange implemented a Corporate Governance Code predicated largely on Anglo-Saxon principles of corporate governance.

" American boards of directors increasingly treat their delegation of authority to management as a careful and self-conscious decision. Numerically dominated by non-executives, boards recognize that they cannot run the company, and many are now seeking to provide stronger oversight of the company without crossing the line into management. Based on interviews with informants at 31 major companies, we find that annual calendars and written protocols are often used to allocate decision rights between the board and management. Written protocols vary widely, ranging from detailed and comprehensive to skeletal and limited in scope. While useful, such calendars and protocols do not negate the need for executives to make frequent judgement calls on what issues should go to the board and what should remain within management. Executives still set much of the board's decision-making agenda, and despite increasingly asserting their sovereignty in recent years, directors remain substantially dependent upon the executives' judgement on what should come to the board. At the same time, a norm is emerging among directors and executives that the latter must be mindful of what directors want to hear and believe they should decide.

" Subsequent to a host of corporate corruption scandals, boards of directors are facing amplified pressure from investors, creditors and shareholders in a bid to ensure effective corporate governance of their investments. In previous research and public debate, the effectiveness of corporate governance structures has come under close scrutiny. However, boards' effectiveness in fulfilling their strategic role by guiding strategy execution mostly has been left unaddressed. Due to the high degree of secrecy and sensitivity of strategy issues, boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution is much more difficult to assess externally compared to structural governance issues. Against the backdrop of these difficulties and based upon insights from strategy process research, we suggest taking \"strategy consistency\" between a firm's resource allocation and its announced strategy as a proxy for boards' effectiveness in guiding strategy execution. In doing so, the paper contributes to extant research by going beyond structural governance issues and paying direct attention to strategic governance issues. Specifically, the paper develops a new approach and set of standard measures to assess boards' effectiveness in strategy execution.

" Analysis of the 2003 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes verifies claims that Australia is a share-owning democracy. We show that higher income earners are most likely to own shares and to own shares in a large number of companies, and that the 45-54 and 54-56 year age groups are the peak for ownership. We also investigate ethical issues relating to share-ownership by examining scenarios under which owners would sell their shares.

" In the area of not-for-profit organisations the role, scope and desirability of governance is an emerging field. Both in academic literature and in practice the attempts to provide for governance of not-for-profit organisations are currently discrete and disparate. This is set to change with the publication by the National Hub of Expertise in Governance of a Code for organisations within the sector. This article examines the appropriateness of the new Code as a tool of regulation for the not-for-profit sector. In particular it focuses upon the challenges facing codes of practice for not-for-profit organisations, such as the identification of shareholders and organisational vision, and the purposes that such codes could have in the not-for-profit sector. The article concludes that whilst there is much of value in the new Code as a governance and regulatory tool, significant aspects the Code remain unclear; particularly the extent of the Code's constituency and the balance to be struck on the issue of compliance.

" This paper provides empirical evidence on how external governance mechanisms (e.g. the reporting and monitoring mandated under government funding contracts) and internal governance mechanisms (e.g. the adoption of corporate governance codes and traditional charity governance mechanisms) are related to the efficiency with which large UK charities meet their charitable spending objects.

" In this paper we develop an integrated approach towards corporate governance and business ethics. Our central argument is that organisations can learn from the development of strategic planning in the 1970s and 1980s. We identify three weaknesses - a bureaucratic and formalised approach, lack of implementation and lack of integration throughout the organisation - which were prevalent in strategic planning in the past and which are potentially just as problematic for an integrated corporate governance approach to business ethics. We suggest ways these weaknesses might be avoided and provide questions for boards of directors to consider when integrating ethical concerns into their organisations' corporate governance structures.

" Under what conditions do stakeholders consent to a regime of corporate governance? We propose that consent by the governed in corporate governance cannot be satisfactorily explained without reference to the collective value of procedural fairness that underlies markets. Drawing on the social psychology of justice and the political economy of social choice, we highlight the critical role played by democratic procedures in achieving consent by the governed in modern society. This line of reasoning leads us to suggest that the evolution of corporate governance, too, can be understood in terms of Tocqueville's well-known hypothesis that democracy eventually prevails in all spheres of organised activity. Examining the historical record of institutional reform in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United&hairsp; States,&hairsp; we&hairsp; find&hairsp; that&hairsp; corporate&hairsp; governance&hairsp; has&hairsp; indeed&hairsp; evolved&hairsp; to&hairsp; make&hairsp; increasing&hairsp; use of democratic procedures. Viewed over the long-term of two centuries of capitalist development, corporate governance is seen to have successively incorporated enfranchisement, separation of powers and representation. In conclusion, we consider the implications of basing the study of corporate governance on the question of stakeholder consent and the practice of corporate governance on the procedures of democracy.

" This paper analyses recent corporate governance codes issued by 20 countries for evidence of convergence in corporate governance systems in Europe. The analysis shows that there has been a degree of convergence towards an Anglo-Saxon model of corporate governance as the audit committee concept is widely accepted in countries with both unitary and two-tier governance systems. Further, the latest audit committee recommendations in countries that have issued several governance codes show a strengthening of the recommendations for an audit committee over time in line with the Anglo-Saxon audit committee concept and convergence with the debate in the US and UK on issues such as the independence and financial expertise of members. However, consistent with the literature on the convergence of European corporate governance systems, at an operational level there is limited consistency in the recommended structure and role of audit committees.

" We analyse the relationship between firm value, as measured by Tobin's q, and newly released indices of effective corporate governance for a sample of 263 Canadian firms. The results indicate that corporate governance does matter in Canada. However, not all elements of measured governance are important, and the effects of governance do differ by ownership category. For the entire sample of firms we find no evidence that a total governance index affects firm performance. This is mainly because we find no evidence that board independence, the most heavily-weighted sub-index, has any positive effect on firm performance. Indeed, for family-owned firms we find that the effect is negative. In general, sub-indices measuring effective compensation, disclosure and shareholder rights practices enhance performance and this is true for most ownership types. We also find no evidence that governance practices are endogenous. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005."
" We suggest that the equivocal empirical results of board leadership structure on firm performance have both methodological and conceptual roots. We stress that whether board leadership structure enhances or lowers performance depends on its fit with a firm's internal and external conditions, a point that has not been comprehensively addressed by the extant literature. To guide future research in this field, we develop five testable propositions and offer some suggestions on how these propositions may be empirically tested. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005."
" This paper examines the effects of board of directors' network characteristics on firm performance using a sample of 199 large, publicly traded Korean companies from 1990 through 1999. Two board network characteristics are discussed, namely: board network density and board external social capital. Board network density is defined as the extensiveness or the cohesiveness of contact among the members of board of directors, and board external social capital refers to the degree to which board members have outside contacts in the external environment. The test results suggest that a moderate level of board network density enhances firm value, while too cohesive a board network destroys it. It is also found that board members' elite school networks were positively associated with firm performance. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005."
" Recent debates on the corporate governance role of institutional investors have centred around whether they monitor their portfolio firms (exercise voice) or vote with their feet (exit). We examine these competing views in the context of how institutions' voice vs exit role, proxied by institutional ownership levels, is associated with their portfolio firms' earnings management in multiple settings. We extend Koh (2003, \"The British Accounting Review\", 35, 105-128) by examining the effect of both short-term and long-term oriented institutional ownership on the extent of earnings management by portfolios firms with different incentives for earnings management. Specifically, we expect that the non-linear relation between institutional ownership and earnings management found in Koh (2003) is more likely to be present for portfolio firms with stronger incentives to meet/beat earnings thresholds. Our results suggest that transient and long-term oriented institutions co-exist and have differential effects on portfolio firms' earnings management. Transient institutions are associated with upward accruals management, while long-term oriented institutions constrain such upward accruals management for portfolio firms that have strong incentives to do so (specifically, firms with non-discretionary earnings below prior year earnings). This suggests long-term oriented institutions can act as a corporate governance mechanism to mitigate aggressive earnings management. Overall, we find that the association between institutional ownership and earnings management is not systematic across all firms and is context dependent, suggesting complex associations between institutional ownership and earnings management strategies exist.

" Agency theorists have put forth a number of internal control mechanisms that can reduce agency problems. These different mechanisms are substitutive and thus it is thought that both the board of directors and large external shareholders can influence CEO compensation. Stewardship theory challenges the presumption of self-interest of agency theory, holding that managers view themselves as stewards of their organisation. The first objective of this paper is to study the influence of the control of the board of directors and large external shareholders on CEO compensation. The second objective is to utilise both stewardship and agency theory to analyse the relationship between control mechanisms and compensation, and to see which theory is more applicable. This paper uses the LISREL model to study the influence that the control of the board of directors and external large shareholders has upon CEO compensation, with data drawn from samples of listed manufacturing companies between the years 1997 and 1999 in Taiwan. The following conclusions are reached: (1) the paper supports the viewpoint of stewardship theory whereby the CEO acts as a steward of his/her company when he/she also holds the position of chairman of the company. (2) The findings show that CEO compensation will be high when the board's control is relatively ineffective. (3) The shareholdings of the board of directors can reinforce the degree of control from the board. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005."
" There is a need for regional studies of women on corporate boards to capture experiences of smaller companies and to understand the nature of local resources for expanding the pool of women candidates for board seats. New findings from a statewide study of women on corporate boards are reported. The paper examines the status of women on corporate boards compared to other regions in the United States and around the world. Change efforts of governments and professional organisations for helping women overcome barriers to the boardroom are described to demonstrate the need for local knowledge in determining an effective change approach. Results from this study indicate that the local pool of women in academia and consulting has provided alternative routes to the boardroom. This knowledge can be used to direct change efforts for promoting women on boards. Practical implications are discussed for women seeking board seats and for firms seeking qualified women director candidates. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005."
" In Australia, as in many Western industrialised countries, women accessing corporate board positions are still the exception to the rule. This paper reports research exploring men's and women's views on the factors crucial in attaining a board position. While both groups identified the importance of a strong track record, a good understanding of business principles and business contacts in gaining board positions, we found that women also highlighted the importance of high visibility and family contacts to account for their nomination to boards. It seems that women's competence has to be widely acknowledged in the public domain or through family connections before boards, or their nominating committees, will be prepared to \"risk\" having a woman on the board.

" Empirical literature on corporate governance often assumes independence among different control mechanisms. However, different studies in the Anglo-Saxon context find that control mechanisms are interrelated. The Spanish corporate governance system, unlike the Anglo-Saxon one, is characterised by the dominance of internal controls, mainly the stock ownership concentration and the board of directors. In this internal control context, we specifically analyse the possible substitution of the supervisory potential of the board outsiders by the incentive effects derived from managerial stock ownership and the supervisory role of large shareholders. Our main results show a negative relationship between the proportion of outside directors and managerial and large blockholders' ownership stake. These findings support the substitution among internal controls and suggest that Spanish firms form an efficient conglomerate of managerial controls, in which deficiencies in a single mechanism can be compensated by the action of an alternative one.
